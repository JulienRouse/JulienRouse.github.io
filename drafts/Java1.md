Two types of data type in Java, that's a reason as why Java is not considered a truly Object language by purist.
There are primitives types
 - `byte` 8-bit signed two's complement integer. [-128;127] . default = 0
 - `short` 16-bit signed two's complement integer. [-32,768;32,767] . default = 0
 - `int` 32-bit signed two's complement integer. [-2^31;2^31-1] . default = 0 . In JavaSE >= 8, possibility to have unsigned int and support of unsigned int with the Integer class
 - `long` 64-bit signed two's complement integer. [-2^63;2^63-1] . default = 0L . In JavaSE >= 8, possibility to have unsigned long and support of unsigned long with the Integer class
 - `float` 32-bit IEEEE 754 floating points. default = 0.0f
 - `double` 64-bit IEEE 754 floating points. default = 0.0d
 - `boolean` true or false. default = false . One bit of information, but real size not precisely defined
 - `char` 16-bit Unicode character. ['\u0000';'\ufff'] . default = '\u0000'
 
String is a class but with special meaning. `String s = 'toto';` will do the same as `String s = new String('toto');`
