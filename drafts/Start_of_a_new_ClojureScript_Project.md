## Start of a new ClojureScript project ##

The last few weeks I have been busy starting a new project in ClojureScript.

- [Emacs/Cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider)
- [klispe](https://github.com/viebel/klipse)
- [reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent)  ([reagent useful doc](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent/tree/master/docs))
- [lein-figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel)
- [cljs.test](https://clojurescript.org/tools/testing)

I set my mind to build a little [Idle game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game) (or incremental game). It's a project I had already done a little prototype last summer with AngularJS, and I wanted to start again with Clojure/ClojureScript and reagent, a binding library to React.


### what's next ###
- [reframe](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame)
- [test.check](https://github.com/clojure/test.check) (and a wrapper for it [test.chuck](https://github.com/gfredericks/test.chuck))
