      <description>&lt;p&gt;First contribution to another project on Github ever! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was very small, the library was a very small and new library that wanted to groups lots of functionalities pertaining to strings for Common Lisp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creator/maintener asked for help on the lisp subreddit and I gave it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a good way to get my feet wet, a very small project with a responsive maintainer that took the time to explains things to me on how to contribute on Github and such.&lt;/p&gt;
