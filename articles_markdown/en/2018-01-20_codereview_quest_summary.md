## CodeReview Quest summary ##

### Preamble ###
This post is a follow-up on the post I made at the start of January. It's probably better to go read it before to get the full picture (or to refresh your memory if you need it). You can read the previous post [here](www.julienrouse.com/template/articles/en/2018-01-06_StackExchange_codereview_quest.html).

### Results ###

I made **5** code reviews from January 6 to February 6:

 - [A review in Python of a stack inplementation](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/184444/87312)
 - [A review in Java of the implementation of Conway's Game of life](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/184519/87312)
 - [A review in Java of a JavaFX program to calculate XP points for fantasy characters](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/185096/87312)
 - [A review in Java of an algorithm to remove occurences of items in an array](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/185247/87312)
 - [A review in Java of a JSON schema validation helper](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/185423/87312)

Three of them got 0 votes, one got 3 positives votes, and one got 5 positives votes. On StackExchange, an answer is considered a top post(meaning a good post) if it reaches 5. So one of my answer qualify for good material, one is 'ok' but not great, and three of them are considered bad or useless(most of those answer were seen by least than 50 peoples, but still nobody voted for it).

### What can be improved ###

For Python, it's been quite some time I haven't done anything meaningful so I couldn't really review the code appart from the style of it (and in this case, the post was asking about `self` in Python and its use and difference with Java `this`), so I did refer the
