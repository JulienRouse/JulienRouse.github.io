## My 2018 list of reading and viewing ##

### Reading ###

For reading I will consider books, regardless of hardcover or digital. I will not consider blog posts, news, etc

 - **The Alchemist** by *Paulo Coelho*
 - **The swords of Night and Day** by *David Gemmell*
 - **Ph√®dre** by *Jean Racine*
 - **Nine princes in Amber** by *Roger Zelazny*, first book out of ten from *The chronicles of Amber* 

### Movies ###

I'll consider only those I've seen at the theater
