      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;milestone&#34;&gt;Milestone&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📖 Celebrating a milestone in the reading group I co-lead at work by writing down how we function and things I learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went past the 100 meetings marks in two-and-a-half year 🥳.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that time, we covered 12 books, 21 research papers and 24 blog articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, we launched a reading group at work with &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.portebois.net/&#34;&gt;Sébastien&lt;/a&gt;, an avid reader and eager to exchange ideas about his readings. We both wanted to be able to learn from our reading, but even more so to meet people from other teams, shares our thoughts and have interesting discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our department has a &amp;ldquo;learning&amp;rdquo; policy, where each week we can dedicate around four hours to explore any topics we want as long as it is helpful for professional development. Some colleagues were taking classes, building tools that do not fit into the roadmap or to learn new technology, or anything else that made sense to them. We decided to invite people for one hour each week to discuss about books and articles we read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;choices-and-tradeoffs&#34;&gt;Choices and tradeoffs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the start, we had several choices to make to organize the group, and some other choices came later one. They all had lasting effects even today.
Those choices were definitely impacted by organizational constraints and by our own goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constraints we had at the time were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we were on a project that was fully remote (it&amp;rsquo;s changing right now, we are back three days to the office and soon full time. We might have to revisit some of those decisions soon).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multiple time zone: Central European Time and Eastern Standard Time for most people (six hours difference). We need to find a good spot in the weeks that overlap with both timezone if we want to be able to reach everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a department of around 100 people at the time (and now around 300), with many small teams and interactions between teams was often very low (&amp;ldquo;silos&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have fun! It is a volunteer activity, we stop when we don&amp;rsquo;t like it anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;meeting people outside our respective teams, in a relaxed setting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sync-or-async-discussions&#34;&gt;Sync or Async discussions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, we were full remote. It would have been easier to organize asynchronous discussions, this would have allowed more flexibility and reach more people. This is also the way most technical reading group function from my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we really wanted to try to connect with people from our department and enable exchange between teams. Moreover, live discussion  allow for a more intimate setting were people feel more free to share their opinions, anecdotes or even to voice a minority opinion on a subject (when it&amp;rsquo;s (&lt;a href=&#34;#recording-meetings&#34;&gt;not recorded&lt;/a&gt;)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tradeoff here is that the barrier to join is higher (less flexibility, active engagement), but the quality of discussions and the human connections are better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;incremental-decisions&#34;&gt;Incremental decisions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the start the goal was to start the group with minimal structure, run a few sessions, get feedback, changes as needed and see where that would lead us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-happens-during-the-meetings&#34;&gt;What happens during the meetings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As said above, we started without too many preconceived ideas on that, and what we currently do evolved over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decide in advance which article or which books and chapter we are discussing (like &amp;ldquo;Next week, chapter X, Y from book Z&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the call, we usually start with a few minutes of informal chat, and then we start with &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;who wants to share notes/impressions/question/anything about chapter X?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. Then we let the discussion flow from there. Everybody shares whatevery they want to share, it sparks discussion (or not), and sometimes it takes us far away from the content of what we were reading but it&amp;rsquo;s totally fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the conversation dies down, we ask if anybody else wants to share something on the current chapter. Otherwise we go on about the next chapter. Rinse, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we finish a book, we take a few weeks of break, ask people if they would recommend the book we just finished (we&amp;rsquo;ll come back to that later in takeaways, especially &lt;a href=&#34;#write-down-the-essentials&#34;&gt;write down the essentials&lt;/a&gt;) and launch a vote for what we read next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;frequency&#34;&gt;Frequency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are doing a weekly meeting, but we take break at the end of most books, and we cancel when we are missing most people (holidays or intense work period mostly). In the end we usually manage around 30 sessions per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping it weekly helps with the discipline and motivation, even if we only commit to discuss one or two chapters at a time. When we have a big gap between sessions, we can feel it&amp;rsquo;s hard for everybody to get back into the flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;recording-meetings&#34;&gt;Recording meetings?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are doing live meeting and not asynchronous one, some people that could not join were asking if we could record so they could follow the discussion on their own time. This is a valid request but we declined after discussing it with the group. We liked the open-minded, relaxed and authentic discussions we were having.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recording put pressure on people. You might not want to say something silly, voice discontent, share a personal anecdote (or many other reasons) if you know it&amp;rsquo;s recorded and any people in the organization might watch it. Additionally, it is very low commitment for the people asking us to record since they might watch it (but most likely would not do it regularly) but require more commitment for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tradeoff here is that we might have reached a larger audience, but we would have lost authenticity in the content of what was discussed, which was not worth it for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;takeaways&#34;&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the takeaways from this experience. Most of it is transferable to many volunteer activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;perseverance-is-key&#34;&gt;Perseverance is key&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make it happen on a regular schedule, for extended periods of time. It takes time for people to show up and stick to any activity. So by making it a regular occurrence, people that wanted to join were having an easier time to manage their schedule to join us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;write-down-the-essentials&#34;&gt;Write down the essentials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a page with essential information about the group was very useful for us. We started with a short wiki page with only a few lines. &lt;code&gt;Current book: &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;, next session &amp;lt;date&amp;gt;, we are discussing chapter&#39;s &amp;lt;X,Y,Z&amp;gt;. You can reach &amp;lt;name&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;name&amp;gt; for questions&lt;/code&gt;. It allowed to have a persistent reference page that people would know they could look up if they needed to, even when we shared messages about it in an ephemeral messaging application (our Slack channels for instances).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, that page grew to contain a FAQ section, and is used to record the history of every book and meeting we had, as well as maintain a list of potential article/books the group would like to read next. That way we can record easily and transparently when someone makes a suggestion, and when the time comes to choose a new book, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to pick a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We even keep a list of the group&amp;rsquo;s favorite book (see &lt;a href=&#34;#links-to-the-groups-favorite-readings&#34;&gt;links&lt;/a&gt;). We use a system of emojis to sort our readings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;⭐ for group&amp;rsquo;s favorite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;✔️ for readings that have good values when shared for work activities. This is most often applicable to short reads, like a particular book chapter or a blog article that we can reference in a code review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;❌ for readings we do NOT recommend at all. Only happened once so far, we tried to cover a book about Domain Driven Design that was still work-in-progress and we stopped after a few chapters. It was missing too much content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;broadcast-information&#34;&gt;Broadcast information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk about your event regularly, you never know when people might join. For us, it means that at the start of each new book discussion we send a message in various communication channels (Slack before, now Microsoft Teams). We give a link to our &lt;a href=&#34;#write-down-the-essentials&#34;&gt;wiki page&lt;/a&gt; and to our community channel in Slack/Teams so people can contact us or share readings with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;future-reading-list-is-never-empty&#34;&gt;Future reading list is never empty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By connecting to people that like to read and learn, as well as by &lt;a href=&#34;#broadcast-information&#34;&gt;broadcasting our group&amp;rsquo;s activity&lt;/a&gt;, we get a ton of recommendation internally by people that don&amp;rsquo;t join our discussion but still like to read. They get to see what we already have read and what we are planning to read (see takeaway on keeping a &lt;a href=&#34;#write-down-the-essentials&#34;&gt;wiki page&lt;/a&gt;), and in return they share what they read recently and that they found interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We even have some people writing technical blogs that shared their articles with us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-cannot-please-everybody&#34;&gt;You cannot please everybody&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the example of &lt;a href=&#34;#recording-meetings&#34;&gt;people asking us to record our session&lt;/a&gt;, you cannot please everybody. That can be hard to accept. But you need to draw a line sometimes to protect the group integrity, and not drive away people that are participating regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since our group is relatively small, we could discuss issues and requests with everybody when needed, which helped too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;let-people-join-as-spectators&#34;&gt;Let people join as spectators&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I did not consider for a long time was to let people that did not read the current chapters to join our group discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we tried it at some point, and it forced us to do a summary of the current chapter, which sparks discussion sometimes as we did not remember the same content. It also leads to people able to share anecdotes or ask question on the topic at hand, which fueled discussion and was interesting for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also helps people that want to &amp;ldquo;try&amp;rdquo; a reading group session before committing on joining us for a full book. They don&amp;rsquo;t have to read anything, they can just join us and see for themselves if the format suits them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a limit to it. If the majority of people did not read the chapters, it can feel a little bit strange and shift the balance towards passive consumers of the meeting instead of being actively engaged in the activity, and that should be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;keeping-tracks-of-group-statistics&#34;&gt;Keeping tracks of group statistics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&#34;#write-down-the-essentials&#34;&gt;writing down&lt;/a&gt; an agenda for each meeting, what we read and what we enjoyed, I was able to put together a quick summary of our activity (same as I shared in the introduction &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;more than 100 meetings over two-and-a-half years [&amp;hellip;] we covered 12 books, 21 research papers and 24 blog articles.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allowed to &lt;a href=&#34;#broadcast-information&#34;&gt;share&lt;/a&gt; those statistics more widely once per year or when we hit a milestone, which gave even more visibility to our activity and helped interest more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not expect how much impact this would have, but it turns out people love stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;making-connections&#34;&gt;Making connections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side effect of running a reading group, I got to meet like-minded people that I would not have had the chance to meet otherwice, because they were on very different team, or not even in engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;links-to-the-groups-favorite-readings&#34;&gt;Links to the group&amp;rsquo;s favorite readings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, here is the list of our group&amp;rsquo;s favorite books/articles over the years (from most recently discussed to least recently discussed):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;books&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>Taking notes</title>
      <link>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/taking-notes/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/taking-notes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was asked to give recommandation on taking notes and knowledge management tools by colleagues a couple time last year so I&amp;rsquo;m sharing it here too, might be useful for other people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;types-of-note&#34;&gt;Types of note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your mileage may vary here. Personnaly, I separate my notes in a few categories with a template for each. It clarify the intent of the note and allow me to get started rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TODO: self-explanatory. You have stuff you need to accomplish and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to worget.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;capture&amp;rdquo;: more &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo; than TODO list, this is where you can write down ideas, observation etc. At first it might sound silly but then when you are able to link those notes to other notes, you might find out that patterns or new ideas emerge. It takes time to get values from these note, that is why consistency helps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;review&amp;rdquo;/&amp;ldquo;learning&amp;rdquo;: you read a book, you watch a conference, you follow a course&amp;hellip; and you might want to write down something you found interesting about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;troubleshooting&amp;rdquo;/&amp;ldquo;tutorial&amp;rdquo;: steps to accomplish a task. Usually when I&amp;rsquo;m debugging a thorny problem, I write down everything I do and the documentation I read because most of the time I need to go back to those notes later to understand better how to solve it efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also choose to not have any category/template and always start from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools&#34;&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features-i-care-about&#34;&gt;Features I care about&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most important features to me are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not being vendor locked. I want to own my notes and my files: being able to export them, use source control on them, write tooling for it&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bidirectional links (&amp;ldquo;wikilinks&amp;rdquo;): being able to see/navigate from a file to where it is referenced is really useful. It allow to get tools to build a graph of note, links ideas together etc. It&amp;rsquo;s not needed however if you only write down TODO list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being able to stay in the text editors I use regularly (Emacs and VSCode right now).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably care about another set of feature but this will put in perspective the tools listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tools-i-use&#34;&gt;Tools I use&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://orgmode.org/&#34;&gt;org-mode&lt;/a&gt;: Killer feature of Emacs. And you get bidirectional links if you use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/gm8jxj/roamlike_behavior_w_bidirectional_links/&#34;&gt;tags&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/toshism/org-super-links&#34;&gt;org-super-links&lt;/a&gt;. But hard to get started if you don&amp;rsquo;t already use Emacs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[Foam]: Plugin for VSCode. Has everything you need to get started if you are a regular VSCode user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-tools-im-aware-of&#34;&gt;Other tools I&amp;rsquo;m aware of&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md/&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;: has everything you need if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to stay in your text editor. And even then, it probably has plugins to help with that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.orgroam.com/&#34;&gt;org-roam&lt;/a&gt;: org-mode on steroid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://logseq.com/&#34;&gt;Logseq&lt;/a&gt;: Looks promising if you don&amp;rsquo;t care for the Electron app&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://roamresearch.com/&#34;&gt;Roam Research&lt;/a&gt;: one of the best tool, inspired a lot of the others in this list. But not free and vendor locked. I am also biased because the tech stack it uses (Clojure/ClojureScript and Datalog) is fascinating me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dokuwiki.org/&#34;&gt;DokuWiki&lt;/a&gt;: Never tried it myself but it&amp;rsquo;s one of the recommended tool in the Zettelkasten community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;going-further&#34;&gt;Going further&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get inspiration from a few sources for knowledge management or writing to help you think:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/&#34;&gt;Zettelkasten&lt;/a&gt; is a very interesting methodology on how to takes note for building knowledge and creating ideas, go check it! There are also a lot of links in the sidebar of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/&#34;&gt;Zettelkasten subreddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/&#34;&gt;Get things done&lt;/a&gt; methodology has some ideas on how to takes note mainly focused on TODO list. Lots of buzzword and commercial BS too so tread carefully. Scott Hanselmans &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hanselman.com/blog/scott-hanselmans-complete-list-of-productivity-tips&#34;&gt;productivity tips&lt;/a&gt; is a good starter for this. Same for his talk &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FS1mnISoG7U&#34;&gt;Scaling Yourself - GOTO 2012&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;University of Chicago leadership lab: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM&#34;&gt;The Craft of Writing Effectively&lt;/a&gt;. Solid resource on the topic of non-fiction writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;most-important-tip&#34;&gt;Most important tip&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just. Do. It.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to spend too much time procrastinating by comparing the differents tools, how to improve your workflow, how to organize your notes, making template, making shortcut to create specific type of notes&amp;hellip;
But it does not matter. Just write down a few notes regularly. And then only when you have the habits of taking notes you can worry about the details slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Print the Go syntax representation of a value</title>
      <link>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/print-the-go-syntax-representation-of-a-value/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/print-the-go-syntax-representation-of-a-value/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I learned a new trick: &lt;code&gt;fmt.Sprintf&lt;/code&gt; (and &lt;code&gt;fmt.Printf&lt;/code&gt;) support a format verb &lt;code&gt;%#v&lt;/code&gt; that prints out a &amp;ldquo;Go-syntax representation of the value&amp;rdquo; (quoting the documentation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this mean: you can ouput a value the way you would write it in valid Go source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;() {

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Printf&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;%#v\n&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// output: []string{&amp;#34;string in the slice&amp;#34;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// To output only the type, you can use `%T` instead
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Printf&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;%T\n&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// output: []string
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-it-useful&#34;&gt;Why is it useful?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me it was useful when using Go template to generate Go code (generating CLI commands from OpenAPI specification).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my input file, I had a slice I wanted to insert into the generated code, but I can&amp;rsquo;t use the value directly, because it&amp;rsquo;s not valid Go code. There is a few workaround (like iterating on the slice to output each value inside and reconstructing the slice) but using &lt;code&gt;%#v&lt;/code&gt; is by far the best approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation for &lt;a href=&#34;https://pkg.go.dev/text/template&#34;&gt;text/template&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation for &lt;a href=&#34;https://pkg.go.dev/fmt&#34;&gt;fmt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Some thoughts about documentation</title>
      <link>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/some-thoughts-about-documentation/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/some-thoughts-about-documentation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing down a few thoughts about documentation, as I realized a few things in the past two years that I did not write down yet, so here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;knowing-the-audience&#34;&gt;Knowing the audience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As software developers, we write documentation but we don&amp;rsquo;t often reflect on who is targeted by the documentation. Sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s the end user that will read it, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s a colleague from another team, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s a non-technical person, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s us in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on who is the most likely reader, we should adapt how we write. A user and/or non-technical person does not need internal or technical details about the system, but might need a glossary, a tutorial and non-technical vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other end, for technical colleagues or for ourselves, we can probably skip the glossary, and we probably wants to dig deeper in details, because that is usually what matters most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;knowing-the-needs-of-the-audience&#34;&gt;Knowing the needs of the audience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related but not quite the same, the same user can come to your documentation multiple time with multiple needs. One time he needs a &amp;ldquo;getting started&amp;rdquo; section to get up to speed quickly, the time after he might want to find some &amp;ldquo;tutorial&amp;rdquo; to get going, and the next time he would look out for &amp;ldquo;references&amp;rdquo; documents to help dig further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same could apply for internal documentation, writing a tutorial vs a getting-started guide is not the same and should be treated differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;give-context&#34;&gt;Give context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more for the technical documentation, either architectural decision record, design document, or most technical document you can think of. This is also applicable for commit message (if using Git).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving context about the system or a change is probably one of the most important things to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you give enough context (requirements, constraints, how the system behave at time of writing), other people should be able to understand why the solution made sense at that time. It is also a good idea to talk about alternative solution, why they were not chosen (a little list of pros/cons can help).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;diagram-are-important&#34;&gt;Diagram are important&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A picture is worth a thousand words. Use diagrams/schemas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you do use diagram, please include the source of the diagram to make sure anybody can update it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;write-more-documentation&#34;&gt;Write more documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We usually are reluctant to write documentation, but it is very rare in my experience that we write enough of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that can help you write documentation is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes&#34;&gt;Scott Hanselman&amp;rsquo;s take on keystrokes&lt;/a&gt;.
Instead of responding on your messaging app or in a mail to one person asking a question, write a blog post or in a wiki or in whatever format make sense, then share it. Overtime, you should be able to link people to your posts instead of responding over and over to the same questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;can-there-be-too-much-documentation&#34;&gt;Can there be too much documentation?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Documentation has a maintenance cost. Outdated documentation can even be dangerous because it can lead to false impression on a system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with a little discipline, and dating the documentation you write to easily spot text that was written a few years ago versus text written last week, that should not be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And frankly, it&amp;rsquo;s rare enough to have too much documentation anyway so this should not be a problem in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-material&#34;&gt;More material&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some links to learn about documentation in various forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4vKPhjcMZg&#34;&gt;What nobody tells you about documentation - Daniele Procida - PyCon AU&lt;/a&gt;. Wonderful presentation, from the experience the Django team has with having great documentation for their project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0&#34;&gt;Django documentation&lt;/a&gt;.  Goes well with the presentation above, can give a good idea of what user-facing documentation can look like when done well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.portebois.net/2021/03/23.html&#34;&gt;Sébastien Portebois&amp;rsquo;s tips for better architecture diagrams&lt;/a&gt;. One of the architect on the project I work for put up together a really thorough post about diagram. Cherry on top is the checklist at the end to evaluate your diagram quickly against common mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Resources about compilers and interpreters</title>
      <link>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/resources-about-compilers-and-interpreters/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/resources-about-compilers-and-interpreters/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been more interested in how compilers, interpreters and programming language are designed lately so I am putting together a list of resources I am using or might use someday. Maybe you can find something interesting too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This document is intended to be updated infrequently to add feedback about those resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reason I am interested in knowing more about that subject (beside the fact that it looks fun) is that I want to learn more about Python in general, and the interpreters is a part of that. So the list might be skewed in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;generic-resources&#34;&gt;Generic resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/Compilers/&#34;&gt;/r/compilers&lt;/a&gt; Subreddit about compilers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://craftinginterpreters.com&#34;&gt;Crafting interpreters&lt;/a&gt; A book that is available online for free, with possibility to buy it on ebook or paper format. Looks really good to get a start and was recommended on /r/compilers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/Compilers/comments/nc3kt4/followup_resources_to_crafting_interpreters/&#34;&gt;thread about followup after reading &amp;ldquo;Crafting interpreters&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aalhour/awesome-compilers#courses&#34;&gt;Awesome compiler&lt;/a&gt; Awesome-style list for compilers. Probably contains more resources than I can consume in a few years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;python&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;python-used-for-implemention&#34;&gt;Python used for implemention&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>Race for the galaxy milestone</title>
      <link>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/race-for-the-galaxy-milestone/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/race-for-the-galaxy-milestone/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;race-for-the-galaxy-milestone&#34;&gt;Race for the galaxy milestone&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2019, I played almost 1000 games of Race for the Galaxy (online on &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamearena.com/&#34;&gt;boardgamearena&lt;/a&gt;). So to mark this milestone, I am writing down a few tips and observations, and hopefully when I&amp;rsquo;ll hit 2000, 5000 or even 10 000 games I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to see if I still agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently around 350ELO on boardgamearena, with a top around 420 last year. Best players are at least 550 I think, so I have a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: all discussions in this post are about the base Race for the Galaxy game, two-players only and with the &amp;ldquo;New Worlds&amp;rdquo; variant. (at the start of the game, choose between two worlds instead of being locked with only one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I won&amp;rsquo;t explain what Race for the Galaxy is in this post, maybe another time. But your favorite search engine will help you find out all about this wonderful card game ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tips&#34;&gt;Tips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-turn-settle-surfing&#34;&gt;First turn settle &amp;ldquo;surfing&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not actually sure what&amp;rsquo;s the actual term for this action, but I call &amp;ldquo;surfing&amp;rdquo; when you bet on the other player choosing a specific action, so you don&amp;rsquo;t take it and choose another one to speed you up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very common way to do this (and quite powerful too), on the first turn is to select the &amp;ldquo;trade&amp;rdquo;/&amp;ldquo;produce&amp;rdquo; phase without selecting the &amp;ldquo;settle&amp;rdquo; phase. This way, if your opponent select &amp;ldquo;settle&amp;rdquo;, you get to draw cards immediately, and because often the first world played is a windfall one, you get to &amp;ldquo;trade&amp;rdquo; the next turn but your opponent won&amp;rsquo;t be able to. So you gain some tempo on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works better if your starting world is a producing one, because then you produce one good at least, and two in the best case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I climbed from 300 to 350ELO recently in large part because I had the opportunity to use this opener, and that helped me snowball faster to the finish line than my opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lost-species-ark-card-is-a-trap-early-mid-game&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lost Species Ark&amp;rdquo; card is a trap early-mid game&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lost Species Ark&amp;rdquo; is a green card costing 5, producing genes good and allowing to draw two cards on the &amp;ldquo;produce&amp;rdquo; phase. For a long time, I thought this card was marvelous and would try to keep it in my opening hand and playing it as soon as possible, because I thought the payoff would be so worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, what it did most of the time was getting me in a situation where I would spend all my cards to play this one, then desperately &amp;ldquo;trade&amp;rdquo;/&amp;ldquo;produce&amp;rdquo; for a couple turn because I was card starved, and if my opponents were half-decent, they would &amp;ldquo;develop&amp;rdquo;/&amp;ldquo;settle&amp;rdquo; so much in the meantime that I would be too much behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost the only way to play this card is toward the endgame, or when you have the 2-cost development that allows you to play any world for free. And having both in your starting hand can sometimes be a great opener if you &amp;ldquo;develop&amp;rdquo;/&amp;ldquo;produce&amp;rdquo; and you surf on your opponent &amp;ldquo;settle&amp;rdquo;. But this is a lot of &amp;ldquo;ifs&amp;rdquo;, most of the time, avoid playing this card early at any cost, it&amp;rsquo;s very rarely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-rare-productionwindfall-worlds--the-6-rare-development&#34;&gt;Two rare production/windfall worlds + the 6 rare development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two rare production/windfall worlds + the 6 rare development can be an opener to &amp;ldquo;consume x2&amp;rdquo;/&amp;ldquo;produce&amp;rdquo; very early and consume 6VPs per round, hopefully closing the game early enough that your opponent will still be trying to find a strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside is that you won&amp;rsquo;t draw any card once you are starting with this, so it&amp;rsquo;s a sink or swin strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to make it work is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have your opening world be the rare windfall world that discounts other rare worlds, one rare world costing one (or two) (preferably a windfall one) and the 6-cost development. This will require you have 8-9 cards in hand to put everythings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first turn: &amp;ldquo;explore +1/+1&amp;rdquo; / &amp;ldquo;trade&amp;rdquo; to get 5 cards. Hopefully, your opponent &amp;ldquo;settle&amp;rdquo; so you can play you rare world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;second turn: &amp;ldquo;develop&amp;rdquo; / &amp;ldquo;produce&amp;rdquo;. If your opponent did not settle the turn before, you hope he does now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your opponent did settle on turn 1 or 2, you now have 2 goods and the development, so you hammer down the &amp;ldquo;consume x2&amp;rdquo; / &amp;ldquo;produce&amp;rdquo; phase to end in 4 turns. If not, you have to waster another turn to settle but usually, people play at least one world early on so I think in most cases you could expect to be set up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;recording-games-to-review-your-play&#34;&gt;Recording games to review your play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is also a tip, but I&amp;rsquo;ll put it in its own category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In various fields, you can read that recording yourself and reviewing your plays can help you see mistakes and correct them. It&amp;rsquo;s true for sports, videogames, and probably a bunch of other activities so let&amp;rsquo;s try it for this game! Also when I face better opponents, that could help me review their game instead of mine to see if I can grab some strategies or tricks from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am only trying this one for the past five games, so I will need to report on the results later on, but what I see right now is that by putting the energy to record myself, I play more focused, which increase my odds of winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also very easy to set up, I use simplescreenrecorder myself but a bunch of alternatives exists (Kazam, OBS to quote a few).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-words&#34;&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to write a bit more about Race for the Galaxy, it&amp;rsquo;s a very fun game (most of the time). We&amp;rsquo;ll see how the next 1000 games will go!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wrong domain to test SSH setup (Gitlab)</title>
      <link>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/wrong-domain-to-test-ssh-setup/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 May 2021 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/wrong-domain-to-test-ssh-setup/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;wrong-server-address-for-ssh&#34;&gt;Wrong server address for SSH&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;story-time&#34;&gt;Story time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was setting up SSH to be able to contact Gitlab repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the very end, when comes the step to test if the connection is
succesful, I followed the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/#verify-that-you-can-connect&#34;&gt;Gitlab
documentation&lt;/a&gt;
(use the command &lt;code&gt;ssh -T git@gitlab.example.com&lt;/code&gt;) and it was
not working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no trouble setting it up for Github a few days before, and the
setup is pretty similar. I could not pinpoint what was going on at
first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured I must have gone a bit fast following the docs, recreated a
new pair of keys, tried again, and still no luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.22/github/authenticating-to-github/testing-your-ssh-connection&#34;&gt;Github
documentation&lt;/a&gt;
to set up SSH, started from scratch again. And still, when it was time
to test the connection, it would not be working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, after at least 30min of trying to understand why, the
realisation came to me (and maybe you understand as soon as you saw the
command): the domain in the doc is not a real one, so I was trying again
and again to test my SSH connection again a non-existent domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I had skipped that step and went straight to cloning a repository,
it would have worked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-read-carefully&#34;&gt;Conclusion: read carefully&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson for this time: even when following a step-by-step guide for
something that should be trivial, pay attention to what the command
contains to not waste time debugging afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emacs again</title>
      <link>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/emacs-again/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 May 2021 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/emacs-again/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;emacs&#34;&gt;Emacs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the start of January, I am trying to switch back to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&#34;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some modes (packages/plugins in Emacs lingo) that I want to
try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;org-mode&#34;&gt;org-mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really drawn out to &lt;a href=&#34;https://orgmode.org/&#34;&gt;Org Mode&lt;/a&gt;, a major mode
(a mode is a plugin in Emacs) to help with todo-lists, planning,
agendas, literate programming and a lot more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used it in the past with
various success, but because I could not use Emacs at work. I stopped using Emacs altogether
to stop switching between editor. I had
settled for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://foambubble.github.io/foam/&#34;&gt;Foam plugin&lt;/a&gt; for
VSCode, which offers some nices todo-list capabilities, an also a good
base for growing a knowledge base in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten&#34;&gt;Zettelkasten&lt;/a&gt; way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, an extension for org-mode appeared:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.orgroam.com/&#34;&gt;org-roam&lt;/a&gt;, wich looks like a serious
contender I would like to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And actually this post is written with org-mode, and exported to
Markdown with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kawabata/ox-pandoc&#34;&gt;ox-pandoc&lt;/a&gt;, an
extension to use the magnificent &lt;a href=&#34;https://pandoc.org/&#34;&gt;pandoc&lt;/a&gt; to export
org files to various format.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;magit&#34;&gt;Magit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is totally new to me, a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/a/6976506/3729797&#34;&gt;porcelain&lt;/a&gt; for Git really
well integrated in Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have heard a lot of good things on &lt;a href=&#34;https://magit.vc/&#34;&gt;Magit&lt;/a&gt;, so it
is on my lists of packages to try!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lsp-mode&#34;&gt;lsp-mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/&#34;&gt;lsp-mode&lt;/a&gt; add support for
&lt;a href=&#34;https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/&#34;&gt;language server
protocol&lt;/a&gt; in
Emacs. I think this idea came originally from Microsoft/VSCode to
simplify the development of tooling for new language and editors. This
looks nice and should allow to have a good experience for most
programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there is some integration with popular packages like Helm,
Ivy and other as well so it might help me to discover new packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot&#34;&gt;eglot&lt;/a&gt; also add support for lsp in
Emacs, but looks less complete at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-packages-that-look-promising&#34;&gt;Other packages that look promising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some less well known packages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dockerel&#34;&gt;docker.el&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Silex/docker.el&#34;&gt;docker.el&lt;/a&gt; is unsurprinsigly a mode
to work with Docker container in Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;kubel&#34;&gt;kubel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/abrochard/kubel&#34;&gt;kubel&lt;/a&gt;
is a package for managing Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered it while watching this very very good video: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3krYEeqnyk&#34;&gt;Conquering
Kubernetes with Emacs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am back in Emacs land, so much to (re)discover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you never heard of org-mode before (or
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&#34;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt;), make yourself a favor and
go try it for yourself. It is such a different experience that you will
learn something for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&#34;Systemctl not found&#34; while installing MongoDB server</title>
      <link>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/systemctl_not_found_while_installing_mongodb_server/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2020 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/systemctl_not_found_while_installing_mongodb_server/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;post-mortem&#34;&gt;Post-mortem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was drafted during &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/my-nanowrimo-in-2020/&#34;&gt;NaNoWriMo 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hit a frustrating problem while deploying to production at work so here is a little postmortem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem came from a Jenkins build, from a repository that had not been updated since a week. We wanted to deploy from a &lt;em&gt;release&lt;/em&gt; branch to &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt;. The error was from an installation of MongoDB server 4.2 in a Dockerfile (not an official Dockerfile from MongoDB but an install of MongoDB server in our own Dockerfile).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spoiler-a-solution&#34;&gt;Spoiler: a solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll give right away a solution for people that don&amp;rsquo;t want to read all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was that MongoDB server 4.3 and 4.4 had a change in a post-installation script (only for Debian I think) that adds a call to &lt;code&gt;systemctl&lt;/code&gt;. That change was backported to MongoDB server 4.2 in October, and was part of an update to the &lt;code&gt;deb&lt;/code&gt; package &lt;code&gt;mongodb-server&lt;/code&gt; around November 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;systemctl&lt;/code&gt; is not present (in my case, in the Docker container based of a Debian image) when the post-installation script is called, the installation of the package fails and the build breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To circumvent that problem, you can run &lt;code&gt;ln -s /bin/true /usr/local/bin/systemctl&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;RUN -s /bin/true /usr/local/bin/systemctl&lt;/code&gt; in the Dockerfile) before trying to install &lt;code&gt;mongodb-server&lt;/code&gt;. This will skip the &lt;code&gt;systemctl&lt;/code&gt; call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You should probably not do that if you need &lt;code&gt;systemctl&lt;/code&gt; elsewhere in your system though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;starting-the-investigation&#34;&gt;Starting the investigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I thought our deployment pipeline had a hiccup. The build was fine on the &lt;em&gt;develop&lt;/em&gt; branch and on the &lt;em&gt;release&lt;/em&gt; branch. It sat there for a full week with no problem. I also checked the last commit from the week before and it was a change to the frequency of a cron job. Not really a &lt;strong&gt;build-breaking&lt;/strong&gt; change usually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I launched the build again. Our infrastructure is a bit weak, we have failing build every other day that can be successful by launching them again. This time it did not solve the problem. I also relaunched the build in &lt;em&gt;develop&lt;/em&gt; to see if it was a problem with the environment, but it also failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could not pinpoint the problem yet but it seemed as if it were not from the new code, nor from the pipeline. Also, the Dockerfile used an official node image, with an exact version (like &lt;code&gt;node:X.X.X-slim&lt;/code&gt;) so I expected things to be pretty stable between each run. The &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; image is itself based on &lt;code&gt;debian-stretch&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I summoned my inner &lt;em&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/em&gt; and went investigating further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;looking-more-thoroughly-at-the-error-message&#34;&gt;Looking more thoroughly at the error message&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First tries did not work. Now I had to dig into the error message a little more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Line 1: &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/dpkg/info/mongodb-org-server.postinst: 43: /var/lib/dpkg/info/mongodb-org-server.postinst: systemctl: not found&lt;/code&gt; means that at the line 43 of a file &lt;code&gt;mongodb-org-server.postinst&lt;/code&gt; there was a call to systemctl that failed because the program was not found&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Line 2: &lt;code&gt;dpkg: error processing package mongodb-org-server (--configure):&lt;/code&gt; this one tell us that its the mongodb-org-server package called with the &lt;code&gt;--configure&lt;/code&gt; package that went badly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Line 3: &lt;code&gt;subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 127&lt;/code&gt; a bit more detail for the line above, not too much info here. &lt;em&gt;This looks like a weirdly worded message&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Line 4-5-6: Other information that comes from the first messages above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you put the first line of the error message &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/dpkg/info/mongodb-org-server.postinst: 43: /var/lib/dpkg/info/mongodb-org-server.postinst: systemctl: not found&lt;/code&gt; into a search engine, you find a SO post&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that contained only an answer at the time and a post with a very similar error. His answer was cryptic to me, howewer, so I had to dig again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the SO post, there is a link to the official Dockerfile for MongoDB 4.4 so I went to take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-truth-is-in-the-dockerfile&#34;&gt;The truth is in the Dockerfile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading it a bit and searching for &lt;code&gt;systemctl&lt;/code&gt;, I found this line in the Dockerfile&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# starting with MongoDB 4.3, the postinst for server includes &amp;#34;systemctl daemon-reload&amp;#34; (and we don&amp;#39;t have &amp;#34;systemctl&amp;#34;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;ln -s /bin/true /usr/local/bin/systemctl \&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that was a good hint. Thanks to all the developers that comments their code :) I tried to add &lt;code&gt;RUN ln -s /bin/true /usr/local/bin/systemctl&lt;/code&gt; to my Dockerfile and it worked! The build was fine now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s not over. I had to understand it to see if it would come bite our project later or if this adds some constraints on the repository because we skipped a step in a post-install script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-why-that-fixed-the-problem&#34;&gt;Understanding why that fixed the problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The part that failed is here&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

systemctl daemon-reload
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;systemctl&lt;/code&gt; is a part of a group of software called &lt;code&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;provides a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the system&lt;/em&gt; (from their website).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-bintrue&#34;&gt;What is &lt;code&gt;/bin/true&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered &lt;code&gt;/bin/true&lt;/code&gt; as a command (&lt;code&gt;/bin/false&lt;/code&gt; exists too!). It&amp;rsquo;s a command that you can use to always return 0 (which is a truthy value in the shell). This is like using a constant for true in shell scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-ln&#34;&gt;What is &lt;code&gt;ln&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew about &lt;code&gt;ln&lt;/code&gt; for links between files on the system before but I never saw it used to replace the comportment of a command by another one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;ln -s /bin/true /usr/local/bin/systemctl
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This command creates a &lt;em&gt;symbolic link&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (not a &lt;em&gt;hard link&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) from &lt;code&gt;systemctl&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;/bin/true&lt;/code&gt;. Like a pointer to it: when you call &lt;code&gt;systemctl&lt;/code&gt;, it will redirect you to the &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; command, and execute it instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;putting-it-all-together&#34;&gt;Putting it all together&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have seen that using &lt;code&gt;ln&lt;/code&gt; in combination with &lt;code&gt;/bin/true&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin/systemctl&lt;/code&gt; did work to allow the build to succeed. But is that right to make it build with a step that is skipped?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I don&amp;rsquo;t know this one for sure (if you know tell me please). My understanding is that the post-install script uses this command to update the configuration of a service &lt;em&gt;if it exists&lt;/em&gt;. But in my case I don&amp;rsquo;t have it so it should not matter if I don&amp;rsquo;t update it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-why-it-hits-us-today-and-not-before&#34;&gt;Understanding why it hits us today and not before?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I would like to understand is why this happened to us this Thursday and not a week ago on the last build, or even a few months before? Maybe answering that could help prevent other build failure in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, looking around in the repository for the Dockerfile for MongoDB where I found the trick to solve my problem, there is a comment&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It indicates that the change for 4.3+ might have been backported, let&amp;rsquo;s find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following commit&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s getting closer but not quite, we last built our project successfully November 12, and it failed November 19. So what could have caused this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;finding-when-the-debian-package-was-updated&#34;&gt;Finding when the Debian package was updated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My best guess right now is that the Debian package &lt;code&gt;mongodb-server&lt;/code&gt; we use in the Dockerfile was updated between the two dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up looking at &lt;a href=&#34;https://packages.debian.org/stretch/database/mongodb-server&#34;&gt;a website for Debian package&lt;/a&gt;, trying to get the changelog but I hit a 404 on the changelog page. Not helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found the &lt;a href=&#34;https://debian.pkgs.org/9/debian-main-amd64/mongodb-server_3.2.11-2+deb9u1_amd64.deb.html&#34;&gt;dpkg list&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;code&gt;mongodb-server&lt;/code&gt; but I dis not find a date of update in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to get the information apart from contacting a maintainer directly. I&amp;rsquo;ll edit the post when/if I find the response.&lt;/p&gt;

         alt=&#34;My take on answering the SO post&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amusingly, the day just before I wrote my answer, someone answered as well in this question. It would have saved time to me but I would not have looked into the problem as much but I am glad I did, I discovered a lot of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;not-deploying-into-master-at-430pm&#34;&gt;Not deploying into master at 4.30p.m.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one should be common sense but we hit this problem around 4.30p.m. on a Thursday and that was not fun. It did not break anything but it add a lot of stress to break a build at the time when you just want to end your day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank my colleague Maxime who was with me at that time and did some initial investigation on the Jenkins builds with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;maybe-another-solution&#34;&gt;Maybe another solution?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I looked around, I tried to search with &lt;code&gt;systemctl not found&lt;/code&gt; into a search engine and found another SO post&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that proposed to install &lt;code&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt;. I did not try it but I expect it might have worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is not the relevant solution for me. We would not use &lt;code&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;systemctl&lt;/code&gt; in this repository so I feel it is better to skip this part of the script we don&amp;rsquo;t need, instead of installing a &amp;ldquo;dead&amp;rdquo; package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, this problem took only a couple of hours to get fixed but it was annoying because of the circumstances. Having a build fail because of an external package being updated is never fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was a good learning experience, I discovered &lt;code&gt;/bin/true&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;systemctl&lt;/code&gt;, I got to look at the MongoDB open-source repository and the docker-library repository and the impact stayed low on the project so not too bad. 😀&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My NaNoWriMo of 2020</title>
      <link>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/my-nanowrimo-in-2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/my-nanowrimo-in-2020/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-nanowrimo-2020&#34;&gt;My Nanowrimo 2020&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always dreamed to be a writer when I was little. It was my answer to everybody that asked me what I wanted to be when I grow up between middle school until late high school. (It was actually my third career choice, my first dream &amp;ldquo;job&amp;rdquo; was being an Eskimo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m a bit far off from that path, but writing slowly for this blog brings me a bit closer to that dream. But I write sporadically and my backlog for new articles is getting full. Getting to it is always the hardest part. So I went on my way to subscribe to &lt;a href=&#34;https://nanowrimo.org/about-nano&#34;&gt;NaNoWriMo&lt;/a&gt;: the National Novel Writing Month!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m not writing a novel. But I joined anyway to prepare drafts and articles for this blog. The goal of NaNoWriMo is to write 50000 words during November.
For some people, it usually means drafting a novel, or a series of essays. For me the goal will be to add 50000 words to my blog (at least to write drafts.) And maybe toward the end I&amp;rsquo;ll write a few short stories if I have a good pace to try my hands at that kind of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help in this journey, you can join a local community of people writing their own things. I joined the one from Montréal (Canada, QC) to have a small community to share my achievements and my hardships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50000 words in a month is a lot. To give some perspective, since I started this blog in 2018, I wrote around 20000 words and published around 12000 of them. So if I &amp;ldquo;win&amp;rdquo; NaNoWriMo this year, I&amp;rsquo;ll more than double what I did previously in approximately two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-plan&#34;&gt;The plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To write that much, I needed a plan. So I started by looking at my backlog of ideas and projects, ordering item, tagging them accordingly. As of today I have around 50 things I want to talk about during NaNoWrimo (and this article is the first one) including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Git and the great value of knowing in depth our tooling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kush Empire: there were black Pharaoh!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The influence of fencing, the great values of this sport and how doing sport at a very high level translates to the workplace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What I read/listen/watch recently that had a big impact on me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python 3.9 and the PEP about adding macros to Python (as in: Lisp&amp;rsquo;s macro, not C&amp;rsquo;s macro)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflection on my mistakes and my wins of 2020&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The benefits of being exposed to many programming languages and paradigms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a lot more hopefully!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also hoping to nourish a habit of writing by pushing me to write every day for a month. For now I intend to write 30 minutes in the morning before work, 30 minutes for my lunch break and 30 minutes or more in the evening. The evening is a bit harder to plan for me but I should be able to at least get a good hour of writing every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obstacles&#34;&gt;Obstacles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know already that a few obstacles are coming ahead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll have a very busy month at work. We are launching in production a service that has been in the working for more than a year without being seen by a user. (I know how much of a great idea this is&amp;hellip;) But in a way, I think doing NaNoWriMo will help me reset my brain from work and that will be a good time to do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need to spend less time on my computer, not more time. Since March, I am working from home (like many people in COVID time). It means I am no longer going outside of my house every day, I can spend sometime 4 hours straight without getting up, and after work I also spend time on my computer for personal endeavour. This means I am spending a huge amount of time in the day at the same place,without moving much. This one is difficult to balance, for now I think I will replace watching random videos on Youtube by writing for my blog but if I want to stay in good shape in the long run, I need to find a way to move more while working, or write somewhere else than the computer. Maybe a dictaphone? Handwriting is good but too slow and I still need to write it down in a digital form afterward so not so good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I plan to write some articles in French. For now it&amp;rsquo;s really difficult for me to write on technical topics even so it is my mother tongue because it always feels weird to have half the vocabulary in French and half in English. Even weirder is translating everything in French, because it becomes really hard to follow. In real-life nobody uses only French terms (in France at least, in Quebec, French is a bit more used for software jargon).
To help me overcome this difficulty, I will use &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitoduc.fr/&#34;&gt;bitoduc&lt;/a&gt;, an English-French dictionary of software terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;let-the-fun-begin-&#34;&gt;Let the fun begin :)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NaNoWriMo started November first, this was the first article of a hopefully long series! I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward for this month and I really like the idea of bursting through a short period of time, with the help and motivation of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever dreamed of writing, be it for a novel, a blog, poetry&amp;hellip; or anything really, join me :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bonus-1&#34;&gt;Bonus 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While daydreaming about how I would go on about doing NaNoWrimo and my old dreams of being a writer, I found a couple interesting link for writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24849485&#34;&gt;To write better, develop a habit of writing&lt;/a&gt; A HN thread about &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookpub.club/post/to-write-better-you-need-to-develop-a-habit-of-writing--1603298302647x354487348376371200&#34;&gt;this eponym article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chrismytton.com/be-prolific/?&#34;&gt;Be prolific&lt;/a&gt; stating that quantity and quality goes hand in hand. The more you produce, the more you progress. The story in the article was actually debunked in many threads in HN or Reddit for having no real source, but I think the meaning being all of it stay true. In my case, if I never write anything in the hope of writing the perfect story the first time I try, it will be a lot less interesting than if I wrote lots of essays to train and grow a style.
I think a caveat here is that producing too much can lead to &lt;em&gt;brain diarrhea&lt;/em&gt;. If you just write everything that goes through your head, quality can be quite low. As always, you must find a balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in general, writing a lot is beneficial compared to writing very little when you want to improve your writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bonus-2&#34;&gt;Bonus 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put in my NaNoWriMo profile that one of my all-time favourite books was Philip Pullman&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Dark_Materials&#34;&gt;His Dark Materials&lt;/a&gt;. But to add it to my list, I had to find the title in English and it&amp;rsquo;s a lot different than in French. I spent some time in the Wikipedia page for it to try to understand why and discovered that one of the major sources of inspiration for this trilogy was John Milton&amp;rsquo;s Paradise Lost. I have reserved a copy already from my local library, I&amp;rsquo;ll have it in 10 days :) I still don&amp;rsquo;t have a good idea for why the name is quite different from one language to another, though :/&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open Invite</title>
      <link>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/open-invite/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Oct 2020 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/open-invite/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoy programming, fencing (especially sabre), history and sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open invite&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want to talk about any of those subject, or if you are looking for help solving a problem, feel free to reach out to me and let&amp;rsquo;s have a chat, I want to talk to you. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Email me at conta&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;-remove-&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:ct@julienrouse.com&#34;&gt;ct@julienrouse.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing so, I follow the steps of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/&#34;&gt;patio11&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://lars.hupel.info/about/&#34;&gt;Lars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hillelwayne.com/open-invite/&#34;&gt;Hillel&lt;/a&gt; (and probably more people I am not aware of). More than one time I was wondering if I could bother someone to exchange about a piece they wrote but I could not muster the courage. These guys make it very clear that you are welcome to reach out to them and it is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I like getting email&lt;/strong&gt;. I can&amp;rsquo;t promess you I&amp;rsquo;ll reply quickly, nor that I will reply at all but I usually read all of my mail. If I don&amp;rsquo;t respond in a timely manner, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to send me another mail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I like a good discussion&lt;/strong&gt;. I like people challenging me, telling me about things I did not know, challenging them back and exchanging ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I like sharing experiences&lt;/strong&gt;. The nicest (software related) interactions I had in the past are usually having a experienced peer help me grow, or me helping a less-experienced peer get on the right track to solve their problem. If you like that kind of exchange, talk to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I like programming and software&lt;/strong&gt;. This is even more true lately when I have to deal with something related to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lisp (I&amp;rsquo;m a bit familiar with Common Lisp and Clojure but anything Lisp-related I&amp;rsquo;m interested)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functionnal programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta-programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Esoteric programming languages (see Piet, brainfuck, J&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Datalog (or query-language or database that are not mainstream but with a good foundation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type System and good/clever use of them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something you can help &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I you see anything wrong with this website, please let me know!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to react to anything I wrote on a post, please let me know!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m always interested to hear about new essays or papers on software engineering. If you have wrote one, or found one and you&amp;rsquo;d like to share, please let me know!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t like social media&lt;/strong&gt; Most of the time I would not want to have a nice exchange on a social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is not an invite for recruiters&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;rsquo;s why Linkedin exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t like phone call&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to speak to me by phone, marry a Rousé.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Scaling Code Review</title>
      <link>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/scaling_code_review/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2020 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/scaling_code_review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;scaling-code-review&#34;&gt;Scaling Code Review&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I hit a problem with my team. Our code review process did not scale up with our team growing (especially in the last weeks). Here are some reflexions on that problem and some reflexions on what we choose to do to see if it improves our process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started as 3 developers more than one year ago, and grew to 6 developers now (and the occasional intern that I will not take into account in my rambling, even though it adds a bit of noise on the line). Our professional experiences range from 3 years to 20+ years as developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-code-review-process&#34;&gt;Our Code review Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process went a bit like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you finish a task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you commit/push your final code on a feature branch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you open a pull request&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you assign the whole team as reviewer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you wait for someone to notice (or you go bug people around on the next daily scrum)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the rest of the team look at it (eventually), add comments if they feel necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you address the comments either by making a change in the code or by responding to the comments (can include a live discussion if there is a lot of clarification to do, or a strong disagreement)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repeat the last two steps until we can come to an agreement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anybody merges the code if there is an approval (or decline the PR if appropriate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For small task it was mostly OK, and on bigger task we would have a lot of back and forth but pretty often we would end up on a meeting just to chat and agree on what needed to be done or not. Not too time consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Side note: we also have a document/checklist with what should be done for a PR to be merged, like presence of unit tests, does it pass all criteria for the task, respect rules in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sonarqube.org/&#34;&gt;sonarqube&lt;/a&gt; etc. I really like that we have this explicit checklist, even if it is not enforced as hard as we probably should.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until four people it stayed OK, but the fifth started to push the limit of this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened most of the time is that at the start of our two-week sprint, everybody went on to take tasks, code happily, and pull requests are opened. Then people started to look at other people&amp;rsquo;s pull request a bit, comment on some things, then go start a new task and sometimes start to address some of the comments on their own pull request. Pull requests took a long time to be closed, and there was always more PR being opened than PR being closed. Then at some point, the pile of stuff to do was empty so people started to look again at the PR, but by that time there was a lot of them, and keeping track of everything was hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code reviews became frustrating and also a bottleneck because QA was waiting for the new features to come out to test them but they had the first week of the sprint almost empty, and the second week very busy. This is far from ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try to fix it, we added a new rule that as a team we MUST close PR as fast as possible. It&amp;rsquo;s a vague requirement but the intent was for people to try to close their PR before taking some more work. It helped but it was not enough, and the sixth developer came shortly after we introduced this rule, and it became unbearable again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m looking to scale up our process, with some suggestion and input from the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problems-that-we-wont-solve-this-time&#34;&gt;Problems that we won&amp;rsquo;t solve this time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diffents-views-on-what-is-clean-code--code-that-can-go-to-production&#34;&gt;Diffents views on what is clean code / code that can go to production&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect that takes a lot of time is discussing what is acceptable or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us are really strict in how much unit testing must be done, how good naming is important, how conventions should be followed to form a coherent code base (not only convention enforced by linter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some of us are more &amp;ldquo;result focused&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;output focused&amp;rdquo; as they like to say. If it &amp;ldquo;works&amp;rdquo;, even if it&amp;rsquo;s a horrible hack, you can ship it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I lean strongly on the first camp, can you tell? My biggest pet peeve is naming. But I also recognize that sometime shipping working code sooner is more important than polishing it for 3 months. As always, you must find a good balance and context can have a huge influence on how much time you have to refactor/clean your code&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this problem is somewhat tangential to our time problem. We need to align people better on what production code should look like, but that is not our main problem in this case I believe (&lt;em&gt;but I could be terribly terribly wrong.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched a few of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kevlin+henney&#34;&gt;Kevlin Henney&amp;rsquo;s talk&lt;/a&gt; recently and I think he has some good bit on this aspect of programming (and many other, go take a look).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of the course the obligatory xkcd comic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/code_quality.png&#34; alt=&#34;Code Quality&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;metrics&#34;&gt;Metrics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First step: to solve this problem I want to gather data, to be able to tell in the future if the changes we implemented as a team works or not. (&lt;em&gt;But be cautious that when you introduce metrics, people find way to abuse them.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;measuring-time-to-close-pr&#34;&gt;Measuring time to close PR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One metric I am interested to improve is time elapsed between opening the PR and closing it. (To be more accurate, one would need to count only business day, that&amp;rsquo;s what I intend to do.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a PR is opened and closed on the same day, I will count the time as 0 day. I&amp;rsquo;m not interested to be more precise than a day here but one could also count it in hour. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it will benefit us though as our PR stay open almost always more than a day I guesstimate &lt;em&gt;spoiler alert: I was mostly wrong on that guess&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;measuring-day-of-the-sprint-the-pr-are-closed&#34;&gt;Measuring day of the sprint the PR are closed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I am interested is on which day PR are closed. If we close all our PR on the last two days of the sprint, it leaves very little room for QA to do her job properly. It&amp;rsquo;s also a very frustrating experience to have fixes incoming, just before the demo or even live during a demo. It&amp;rsquo;s nerve wrecking, and not how I envision to work as professionally as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;number-of-comments-on-each-pr&#34;&gt;Number of comments on each PR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is mostly curiosity on my part: does amount of comment correlate closely with time to close PR?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuitively I think that it would be the case but sometimes you get surprise with intuition so I wanted to know. &lt;em&gt;spoiler alert: it does correlate weakly, but less than what I thought&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-in-image&#34;&gt;Data in image&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took advantage of 35 min before the last meeting of the week, on a Friday morning to gather the data on our sprint. I did it &amp;ldquo;by hand&amp;rdquo;, opening every PR that was closed since the start of the current sprint and filling a table in Excel. I think it took me around 20 min to get all the data. If I had to do that every week, I would like to automate this process. Maybe Bitbucket has an API or a plugin? But for now I intend to do it at most three times so I do not see the need to automate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are three graphics I plotted in Excel with the data I freshly gathered (&lt;em&gt;with some French in it&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is the number of days to close a PR on the x-axis, and number of PR that were closed in that many days in the y-axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/img/blog_15_pr_data_number_of_days_to_close_a_PR.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Number of days to close a PR&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows that contrary to my guesstimate above, we do close quite a lot of PR in less than one day. Obviously those includes configuration changes, very small fixes and people merging their own PR without waiting code review to go fast&amp;hellip; But still, it&amp;rsquo;s a decent number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the opposite spectrum, we have some PR that took more than 2 days to close. (The one that took 11+ days was a draft PR opened at the start of the previous sprint, and closed at the beginning of the current sprint. It is an outlier but I kept it anyway). Those are the one we are looking to get rid of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second plot is the frequency of PR merged by day. x-axis is the day of the week (in French but you can probably work with it ;) ), with the week number as a suffix. &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo; for the first week of the sprint, &amp;ldquo;2&amp;rdquo; for the second week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/img/blog_15_pr_data_frequency_of_PR_merged_by_day_of_sprint.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Frequency of PR merged by day of the sprint&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is not too surprising I think, lots of PR being closed on the last 3 days before the demo on the last Friday of the sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the last one, the number of comments on the y-axis and the time it took to close a PR in day on the x-axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/img/blog_15_pr_data_correlation_comments_vs_time_to_close_a_PR.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Correlation number of comments vs time to close a PR&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This did surprise me a bit more. You can still see that every PR that stayed open more than 2 days have some comment in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have also PR with 30 comments that were closed in one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to interpret this one yet, I will wait for the next time to see if I can get more insight. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m also needing more context on each PR to better understand what this graph shows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ideas-to-improve-the-process&#34;&gt;Ideas to improve the process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I will present some of the ideas we brainstormed, the one we decided to try to implement and the one we did not pick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;instead-of-putting-everybody-as-a-reviewer-on-each-pr-we-could-only-put-two-peoples&#34;&gt;Instead of putting everybody as a reviewer on each PR, we could only put two peoples.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benefits would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to reduce noise (less cooperation needed, less time spent finding a time where everybody is available)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows to have a tie when disagreeing (two reviewers and the one opening the PR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;faster agreement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time spent overall for the team on one pull request should be divided by a factor X, with X probably in the range [1.5, 3] if I&amp;rsquo;m being optimistic. There is nothing scientific in that estimation, only gut feeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people not reviewing the code will be less familiar with the whole code base (unless they go read the PR for themselves but restrain from commenting unless big mistake).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to choose the pair to review
I&amp;rsquo;d like to try this one, but I&amp;rsquo;m a bit torn on how to choose the pair of reviewers. It is always the same people together? Random pair? Familiarity? Time available at the time of deciding who&amp;rsquo;s going to take care of it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;put-one-person-in-charge-of-all-pr&#34;&gt;Put one person in charge of all PR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One developer main task for a sprint could be to review and approve/fix - we decided against this. The goal is still to share knowledge for the whole team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;put-one-person-in-charge-of-one-pr&#34;&gt;Put one person in charge of one PR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each PR has one main reviewer - We are going to try this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We put everybody as a reviewer on the PR in Bitbucket, but only one of use is responsible for accepting/declining. Everybody is still welcome (and encouraged) to go take a look at the PR, and comment on things that are major flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;put-one-person-in-charge-of-merging-all-pr-related-to-one-repository&#34;&gt;Put one person in charge of MERGING all PR related to one repository&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one was - in my eyes - an interesting suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the main bottleneck was that 3 or 4 PR landed on the same repository, for many different features and write in the same files. Without someone in charge for the coordination, it looks like a mess to merge everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to go with this one, and to keep things light, to just decide at the daily scrum in the morning if we needed to have people step up for the merge-coordination duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dont-commit-uninvited-to-someone-elses-branch&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t commit uninvited to someone else&amp;rsquo;s branch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one should be a no-brainer but if you push things on somebody else&amp;rsquo;s branch without communicating/cooperating, bad things might happen. At the very least, it can be frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While obvious, I (and others on the team) have been doing it on some occasion so we are trying to reiterate on the fact that we should really avoid doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;flag-comment-in-pr-with-priority&#34;&gt;Flag comment in PR with priority&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people were complaining that sometimes we would not close PR because there were comments that nobody answered, but those comments were irrelevant, only rhetorical or not important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we decided to add a little flag like &amp;ldquo;question:&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;important:&amp;rdquo; in our comment when applicable to help the reviewer get a feel for when everything important is fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one I have mixed-feeling about, I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of the team will forget about it in the first 2 days, me included. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice-to-have, but I have a feeling it will take a long time before everybody follow this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we are trying right now all of this, but we are also doing the biggest release in production for the project since 18 months so I expect that we won&amp;rsquo;t follow half of what we set out to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still now we have some really nice ideas to improve, and when things settle down I expect the team to abide by the new rules we set for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, the team did a really good job to come up with ideas on how to improve, and the process was very smooth. All the frustration from the previous weeks on this topic turned into a very productive 30 min meeting on getting better at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not always end up so well, but I think it is also the result of our team growing together. Whatever the outcome of our experiment is, we are still a better team this week that the previous one and that is amazing to witness.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction to Mutation Testing</title>
      <link>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/introduction_to_mutation_testing/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;mutation-testing&#34;&gt;Mutation Testing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why slaying mutants is good for measuring the quality of your tests.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem-assessing-test-quality&#34;&gt;The problem: assessing test quality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test automation of a piece of software is a well developed practice these day. But assessing the quality of those tests is not easy. One really big mistake is to rely on coverage because you can have 100% (or close to) coverage but still having really low test quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you have a beautiful function &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; defined as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;/* Return the answer to life, the universe and everything */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;(){
	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And your test looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// very basic version of a test, hopefully very far from a real-life example
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;resultFoo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;();
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;result of foo should be 42&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you run the test with your favourite test runner, it will pass! (obviously because we passed &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; function call) You get the greenlight. Even sadder, you also get a 100% coverage for this function because we called it in the test (even if we don&amp;rsquo;t use the result of that call to determine if the test pass or not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this is a contrived example to put emphasis on my point above that coverage is not a reliable metric for code quality. (At the bottom of the article I link to a Kata revolving exactly around this idea of false coverage, and about fixing bad tests)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-solution-mutation-testing&#34;&gt;A solution: mutation testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to get more confidence into you test suite is to use Mutation testing. The way it works is by changing a tiny bit of your code, say replace &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; in one place in your code, then run your test suite against the modified version of your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new version of your code is called a &lt;em&gt;mutant&lt;/em&gt;. If all your tests pass on the mutant, it means your test quality is not good enough because it did not catch this change. In this case the &lt;em&gt;mutant&lt;/em&gt; is sometimes called a &lt;em&gt;zombie&lt;/em&gt; because it lives (did not get &amp;lsquo;killed&amp;rsquo; by the test suite).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you repeat the process of introducing another mutation from the original code to create another &lt;em&gt;mutant&lt;/em&gt; (say this time you replace &lt;code&gt;let c = new Foo()&lt;/code&gt; by  &lt;code&gt;let c = null&lt;/code&gt;) then you run the test suite again and you determine if the mutant has been killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rinse and repeat a lot, then you count how many mutant you killed in relation to how many were produced. This ratio is called the mutation score, and should be as close to 1 as possible. Mutation testing allows to be more confident in the test you write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main assumption behind mutation testing, let&amp;rsquo;s see what they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is the &lt;em&gt;competent programmer&lt;/em&gt; hypotheses. It states that most bugs introduced by an experienced programmer into a codebase are small syntactic errors. The second one is the &lt;em&gt;coupling effect&lt;/em&gt; hypotheses. It asserts that simple faults can create other faults/bugs in an emergent/cascading fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mutation-operator&#34;&gt;Mutation operator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes in the code (replacing &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; like in the first example)  are called &lt;em&gt;mutations&lt;/em&gt;, and they are defined by &lt;em&gt;mutation operator&lt;/em&gt;. There are many different families of &lt;em&gt;mutation operator&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have operator on (non-exhaustive list):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boolean: &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;arithmetic: &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;statement deletion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;statement duplication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OOP: replacing call for object constructor by &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, changing method and field scope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator specialized for specific features of a programming language (like C++) &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operators for security purposes&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pitfalls&#34;&gt;Pitfalls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it&amp;rsquo;s not all good, if it was we&amp;rsquo;d be using it in every project since it was invented (in the 70&amp;rsquo;s!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;instability-of-the-mutations&#34;&gt;Instability of the mutations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we mutate pieces of code, it happens that mutant causes a crash or an infinite loop (when say you change the condition on a loop) and that hinders the tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some mutation testing framework deal with that by letting you disable some classes of mutations operator if it does not play well with your codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases you get a timeout for that mutant, so you don&amp;rsquo;t get a clear result. And it can slow down considerably your mutation testing run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;performance&#34;&gt;Performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another negative thing (and, from what I understand, until recently the major drawback that prevented spreading of mutation testing) is that for even a small code base you can generate hundred or thousands of mutants. Then you need to tests every one of them. That&amp;rsquo;s a huge resource sink, that could only be overcome for small projects or medium-big projects with huge resources. (Remember the idea was first devised in the 70&amp;rsquo;s)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have much more resources at hand so it is less a problem but still, that can quickly add time to your test pipeline (especially if your test suite is slow). To help the performance aspect, there are numerous optimizations that have been devised, like only generating mutation for line of code that are covered by at least a test, testing the mutants by running only the specifics tests that covers the line with the mutation instead of the whole test suite etc. This make using mutation testing a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is to use extreme mutation (the paper &amp;lsquo;Will My Tests Tell Me If I Break This Code?&#39;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is a good read). Basically extreme mutation will remove any code from a tested function, and replace it with a value of the type of the method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This generates less mutant so is quicker to test. You can find &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/STAMP-project/pitest-descartes/blob/master/docs/performance-comparison.md&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; a comparison of regular mutation vs extreme mutation testing of various java library with the framework Pit using a standard generator (called Gregor) and a extreme mutation generator (called Descartes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below you can find the result of that comparison:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Descartes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that going from extreme mutation to standard mutation testing is roughly an order of magnitude in number of mutant generated and time taken to test every mutant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it sometime, for me it was really fun and eye opening to catch bad tests I wrote!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And remember:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Software testing proves the existence of bugs not their absence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The original paper that first described mutation testing: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2957629_Hints_on_Test_Data_Selection_Help_for_the_Practicing_Programmer&#34;&gt;R.

&lt;li&gt;If you are interesting to know a bit more about different techniques and different tradeoffs to implement mutation testing, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://pitest.org/&#34;&gt;PIT&lt;/a&gt; library (Java) has a good overview on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pitest.org/java_mutation_testing_systems/#mutant-generation&#34;&gt;mutant generation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://pitest.org/java_mutation_testing_systems/#test-selection&#34;&gt;test selection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://pitest.org/java_mutation_testing_systems/#mutant-insertion&#34;&gt;mutant insertion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://pitest.org/java_mutation_testing_systems/#mutant-detection&#34;&gt;mutant detection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Rust, TLA&#43;, Aesthetics and more</title>
      <link>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/rust_tla&#43;_and_more/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;rust-tla-aesthetics-and-more&#34;&gt;Rust, TLA+, Aesthetics and more&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while I have not  put my thoughts in here, so this entry will be a mix of some of the papers or blogs I read recently, some thoughts about Rust and TLA+ because I started trying them both recently, and a few interesting talks I saw recently. The Aesthetics part will be discussed in the blog entry that I read recently and was an interesting reflection on how tools shape our way of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tla&#34;&gt;TLA+&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll start by talking about TLA+ because it lead me to other subjects I&amp;rsquo;ll talk after. I discovered TLA+ after reading a few blog posts seen on &lt;a href=&#34;https://hn.algolia.com/?q=tla%2B&#34;&gt;HackerNews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically the idea behind TLA+ is that writing software that is correct is extremely hard to do (more so is you include concurrency/parallelism in your software). TLA+ is a high-level language for modeling systems, that relies on math to check the correctness of the model. It has been used successfully by engineers in big company like Amazon and Intel to help them design robust systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLA+ is mainly the work of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport&#34;&gt;Leslie Lamport&lt;/a&gt; (I did not know about him before), a fairly well-known computer scientist known for his work in distributed systems (and being the initial developer of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.latex-project.org/&#34;&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt;). He received many prizes including the Turing award in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&#34;http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html&#34;&gt;The TLA+ Home Page&lt;/a&gt; there is lots of resources to start using it, links to the toolbox, an introductory video course and more information to get started. I am currently at the seventh lecture of the introductory course and it is an interesting concept that I&amp;rsquo;m willing to try to put in practice. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably come back writing back more on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rust&#34;&gt;Rust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rust-lang.org/&#34;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt; is the &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; language (since 2010) developed by Mozilla with the goal to have a &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo;, low-level and performant programming language (as an alternative for C/C++). It features quite a few interesting ideas that I find intriguing and I decided to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What drew me in was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;immutability: something that I really like about Clojure as well! In Rust it seems it&amp;rsquo;s an opt-out feature, if you declare a variable like &lt;code&gt;let x = 0&lt;/code&gt; it is immutable but you can opt-out with the keyword  &lt;code&gt;mut&lt;/code&gt;  (as in   &lt;code&gt;let mut x = 0&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;low-level: I have a very limited exposure to low-level languages (and concepts). I did quite a lot of C in my university classes and an internship in C++ dealing with OpenGL but to be honest I forgot most of it. So that will be a good opportunity to get back to low-level programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no runtime: I read about that and I have no idea what does this mean in practice but I want to find out! Right now my idea of that is that Rust is embeddable is other programs via C/C++ FFI with no overhead. I hope to be able to call Clojure code from Rust and vice versa (I saw some repos and blog post about it so it seems definitely doable).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;safe: It seems Rust does a lot of compile time checking to ensure safety and correctness (even for threaded/concurrent program). As far as I understand, it is thanks to is rich type system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another good point is that because Rust is a recent language (and good fundings), it has all the niceties like package manager (Cargo), utilities for documentation included (seriously running &lt;code&gt;cargo doc --open&lt;/code&gt; is really a nice experience!), nice integrations to the majors editors, installation is very straightforward, so far documentation is really high quality&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started the &lt;a href=&#34;https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/&#34;&gt;Rust book&lt;/a&gt;, very nicely done so far (I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of chapter 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be progressing toward the end of this book and then try my hands with it. It should match very well with TLA+ as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blogs&#34;&gt;Blogs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t talk here about all the interesting blog posts I read since the last time I wrote in this blog (a few months ago) but I wanted to highlight and share some very interesting read I had this past few months:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;software-aesthetics-and-craft-how-java-lisp-and-agile-shape-and-reflect-their-culturehttpswwwinfoqcomarticlessoftware-aesthetics-craft&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.infoq.com/articles/software-aesthetics-craft/&#34;&gt;Software, Aesthetics, and Craft: How Java, Lisp, and Agile Shape and Reflect Their Culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, the author compare the difference between &amp;ldquo;classical&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;gothic&amp;rdquo; architecture (real architecture, not software architecture), the elements that characterize both (notably in how much freedom is given to the craftsman) and how we can think about programming language in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This piece is really nice and I really think you should read it too :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-i-became-a-better-programmerhttpsjlongstercomhow-i-became-better-programmer-from-james-long-creator-of-prettier&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jlongster.com/How-I-Became-Better-Programmer&#34;&gt;How I became a better programmer&lt;/a&gt; from James Long (creator of Prettier)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is like many others on the internet where the author describes how he try to be a better programmer. Very quickly his point his:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find inspiration in other people put keep a critical eye on their work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t feel pressured to work all the time, truly revolutionary stuff happens only every few year at best&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignore fluff. Learning syntax and the specific API of a new tool is far less interesting in the long run compared to deep knowledge like algorithm, data structure, how a compiler works, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for previous research about what you are trying to solve, it will probably change your mind in a lot of ways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take on big projects. Get uncomfortable. By trying to accomplish new thing you learn much more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then he list a few things that helped him be a better programmer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a compiler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn macros (as in Lisp macro, not C macro)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SICP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand continuations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try a new language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jlongster.com/#posts&#34;&gt;His blog&lt;/a&gt; his overall pretty interesting too so go take a look :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;viability-of-unpopular-programming-languageshttpswwwjohndcookcomblog20180417unpopular-languages-by-john-d-cook&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2018/04/17/unpopular-languages/&#34;&gt;Viability of unpopular programming languages&lt;/a&gt; by John D. Cook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog posts of John are very interesting (and very short) so if you like a quick read go for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this one he rants about how we rank programming language by popularity (whatever that means) but that does not define how viable that language is (taking Perl, Common Lisp, F# and Erlang as examples).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;misc&#34;&gt;Misc&lt;/h3&gt;

Notably one of the latest book is a compilation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.1145/3335772&#34;&gt;the work of Leslie Lamport on concurrency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tutorial for an Idle game with Svelte (Part3)</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;part3-adding-upgrades-to-the-game&#34;&gt;Part3: Adding upgrades to the game.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is the third part of a tutorial aiming at discovering Svelte while building a game. I also wrote a short post on Svelte and the idea behind this tutorial. Below you can find the links to check those posts or other parts of the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/introduction-to-svelte/&#34;&gt;introduction to Svelte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/tutorial-for-idle-game-svelte-part1/&#34;&gt;part1: Start of the tutorial: making a Derivative Idle clone with Svelte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/tutorial-for-idle-game-svelte-part2/&#34;&gt;part2: Going further with Svelte using components and props&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/tutorial-for-idle-game-svelte-part3/&#34;&gt;part3: Adding upgrades to the game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this part we will focus mostly on how to implement an upgrade system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;upgrades&#34;&gt;Upgrades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we will implement upgrades for our game. Upgrades are buyable bonuses that grants bonuses to production in many way. The most straightforward is giving a multiplier bonus to the production of a building. That&amp;rsquo;s what we will be working on right now. Note that Clicker Idle upgrades gives a bonus to buildings depending on how many specific building has been bought by the player (not the total number of building the player has, because we have buildings producing other buildings). We will have to track that number bought to implement the upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also Derivative Clicker gives the same bonus to all the buildings on the same row (all the buildings on the top row are tier1 buildings, producing a currency, then tier2 buildings on the second row produces tier1 buildings and so on and so forth for tier3, tier4&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example: if the bonus is 1% bonus to tier1 building for each tier1 buildings bought, if you buy 5 &amp;ldquo;1th Derivative&amp;rdquo; and 5 &amp;ldquo;Combinatorics&amp;rdquo; buildings, you have 10% bonus to all of those buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;differentiating-building-bought-and-building-total&#34;&gt;Differentiating building bought and building total.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do that first thing is to create a variable in &lt;code&gt;store.js&lt;/code&gt; to handle the new information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;/* store.js */&lt;/span&gt;
...
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// first level buildings
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;firstDerivativeNum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;writable&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;firstDerivativeBoughtNum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;writable&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;combinatoricsNum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;writable&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;combinatoricsBoughtNum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;writable&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;);

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// second level buildings
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;secondDerivativeNum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;writable&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;secondDerivativeBoughtNum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;writable&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have that, we can define props for the buildings and adjust the template:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;21
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;22
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;23

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;26

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;30
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;31
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;32
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Building.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// imports declarations
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  ...
  
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// variables declarations
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  ...
  
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// props declaration
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  ...
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;numberOfBuildingBought&lt;/span&gt;;
  
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// reactive declarations
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  ...
  
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// functions declarations
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  ...
  
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;updateNumbers&lt;/span&gt;(){
    ...
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;numberOfBuildingBought&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; =&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;);
  }
  
  ...
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

...

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  ...
  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;Owned:{$numberOfBuilding} ({$numberOfBuildingBought})&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now we can import the new stores and pass them to our Building components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixing-an-accidental--bug-feature&#34;&gt;Fixing an accidental  &lt;del&gt;bug&lt;/del&gt; feature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last part we introduced a bug. A building&amp;rsquo;s cost is dependent on how many of that building there are. But now that other buildings can generate buildings themselves, that&amp;rsquo;d be better if the cost would be associated with how many buildings were bought, not how many there are in total. Because we already solved the issue of differentiating bought versus total, the fix is as simple as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;

&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-new-component-for-upgrades&#34;&gt;A new component for upgrades&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s define a new component. To do that, let&amp;rsquo;s create a new file called &lt;code&gt;Upgrade.svelte&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their states will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how many we bought (you can buy the same upgrade many times)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they will have a cost that scale of of how many we bought&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they&amp;rsquo;ll have a name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrade component has a lot in common with the Building component, it is even a subset of it. We can copy the Building component and remove what we don&amp;rsquo;t need. (Mostly anything that has to do with producing things).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is this:&lt;/p&gt;

  }

  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;cantbuy&lt;/span&gt; {

&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;on:click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{updateNumbers}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;class:cantbuy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{cantBuy}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;disabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{cantBuy}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;{name}&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then as usual we need to define new variables in the store to hold the number of upgrade bought:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;/* store.js */&lt;/span&gt;
...
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// upgrades
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;firstRowBoughtNum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;writable&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally let&amp;rsquo;s use the new component in &lt;code&gt;App.svelte&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;16

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;21
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;22

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- App.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// import declarations
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  ...
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Upgrade&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;./Upgrade.svelte&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;

  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// variable declarations
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// reactive declarations
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// function declarations
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;	
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// lifecycle functions

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

...

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Upgrade&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;First row&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;numberOfUpgradeBought&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{firstRowBoughtNum}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Upgrade&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made another big ugly thing here, using the div around the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Upgrade&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag to push it down the page. We will refactor all those ugly bits at the end of the tutorial because let&amp;rsquo;s face it it&amp;rsquo;s not the most interesting things to spend time on right now. But keep in mind that this is not the nicest way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have to modify how &lt;code&gt;Building.svelte&lt;/code&gt; calculate how it produces its currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to have a props to know the bonus given by the upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also we need to move things a bit, before we had a variable &lt;code&gt;buildingProduction = 1&lt;/code&gt; which is gonna be replaced by a reactive declaration taking account the bonus given by the upgrade given as a prop, and this will impact &lt;code&gt;productionPerTick&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  ...

&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used &lt;code&gt;Math.floor()&lt;/code&gt; to restrict the upgrade bonus to only whole number, so if a building produce initially 10 unit of currency each tick, with a bonus of 25%, it actually produces 12 unit per tick and not 12.5. For now I will let it that way, even so the upgrade is weaker than what is advertised, it is made to deal only with Integer (Num) and not Float or Double. Another way to do this is to calculate correctly the upgrade without flooring or rounding and to only apply the rounding on the number when we display it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note also that is the formula we have twice the magic number &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; which refers to the initial number of unit produced by the building. I will let it that way for now, but in the future we will change it to allow for more flexibility when creating buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we need to change &lt;code&gt;App.svelte&lt;/code&gt; to calculate the upgrade bonus and pass it to the buildings. For now for each building of the first tier we will get 25% bonus. These numbers are for development purpose and will be changed when we will balance the game progression.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Upgrade&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;First row&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;numberOfUpgradeBought&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{firstRowUpgradeBoughtNum}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Upgrade&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great! Now we can buy upgrades for our first tier buildings :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that is far from perfect is &lt;code&gt;$: firstTierBuildingBought = $firstDerivativeBoughtNum + $combinatoricsBoughtNum;&lt;/code&gt;. Every time we are gonna add a new tier1 building, we are gonna need to update this. For now we will keep it that way but maybe later on we will find a way to simplify this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;extending-the-upgrades-for-the-second-tier-and-adding-an-initial-cost-to-upgrades&#34;&gt;Extending the upgrades for the second tier (and adding an initial cost to upgrades)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you looked carefully at the last code snippet we used a placeholder for the upgrade bonus of &amp;ldquo;2nd Derivative&amp;rdquo; &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Building name=&amp;quot;2nde Derivative&amp;quot; currencyProduced={firstDerivativeNum} numberOfBuilding={secondDerivativeNum} numberOfBuildingBought={secondDerivativeBoughtNum} upgradeBonus={0}&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Building&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be better to implement the upgrade for that tier of building too and it is pretty straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need to add a new value in the store:&lt;/p&gt;

  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Building&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;2nde Derivative&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;currencyProduced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{firstDerivativeNum}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;numberOfBuilding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{secondDerivativeNum}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;numberOfBuildingBought&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{secondDerivativeBoughtNum}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;upgradeBonus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{secondTierBuildingUpgradeBonus}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Building&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Upgrade&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;First row&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;numberOfUpgradeBought&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{firstRowUpgradeBoughtNum}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;initialCost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{100}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Upgrade&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Upgrade&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Second row&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;numberOfUpgradeBought&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{secondRowUpgradeBoughtNum}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;initialCost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{10000}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Upgrade&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time we pass an initial cost to the upgrade so that the first upgrade cost 100 time less than the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I put the Buildings into div to make the second tier building on a row below the first tier building. As usual, it is to not use CSS now, but at the end we&amp;rsquo;ll do a cleanup phase to use proper semantic for HTML and use CSS when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-a-second-tier-building&#34;&gt;Add a second tier building&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A last thing before wrapping up this part, we&amp;rsquo;ll add a second tier2 building that will produce &lt;code&gt;Combinatorics&lt;/code&gt; to make things even (two tier1, two tier2 and two upgrades). To do that we need to have the proper values in &lt;code&gt;store.js&lt;/code&gt; then adding the component into &lt;code&gt;App.svelte&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;

...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;16

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- App.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// import declarations
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  ...
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;money&lt;/span&gt;, ..., , &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;probabilityNum&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;probabilityBoughtNum&lt;/span&gt;, ...} &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;./store.js&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
  ...
  
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// variable declarations
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  ...
          
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// reactive declarations
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  ...
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;secondTierBuildingBought&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;$secondDerivativeBoughtNum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;$probabilityBoughtNum&lt;/span&gt;;
  ...
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

...



&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This works fine and to finalize it, we should modify the function that display the currency the building is producing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;/* utils.js */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; { ..., &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;combinatoricsNum&lt;/span&gt; } &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;./store.js&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// Returns a string representing `currency`. If `c` is not recognized, returns &amp;#39;?&amp;#39;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;currencyToString&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;){
  ...
    
  ...
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;combinatoricsNum&lt;/span&gt;)
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34; Combinatorics&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;

  ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That will display nicely on the new building that he is producing &amp;ldquo;Combinatorics&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;recap&#34;&gt;Recap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the end of this part, this time we implemented a new tier2 building and a basic upgrade system. The full code follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also play with the game and the code in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://svelte.dev/repl/ae7ab07c14804b9f92b631dca91bd129?version=3.4.2&#34;&gt;Svelte REPL&lt;/a&gt; or just enjoy &lt;a href=&#34;http://tuto-derivative-clicker-part3.surge.sh/&#34;&gt;the game made so far&lt;/a&gt; (hosted by Surge).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;going-further&#34;&gt;Going further&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to go further and see if you understood how the game works, here is some elements you can try to add to the game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another tier1 building that cost &lt;code&gt;proof&lt;/code&gt;  and generate money(and called &amp;ldquo;Computer&amp;rdquo; if you want to follow closely Derivative Clicker).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another tier2 building that costs &lt;code&gt;proof&lt;/code&gt; and generates &lt;code&gt;Computer&lt;/code&gt; (see the point above)  called &amp;ldquo;Assembly line&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next article will be the conclusion on this tutorial, with resources for going further and my opinion on Svelte so far.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;part2-going-further-with-svelte-using-components-and-props&#34;&gt;Part2: Going further with Svelte using components and props&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is the second part of a tutorial aiming at discovering Svelte while building a game. I also wrote a very short post on Svelte and the idea behind this tutorial. Below you can find the links to check those posts or other parts of the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/introduction-to-svelte/&#34;&gt;introduction to Svelte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/tutorial-for-idle-game-svelte-part1/&#34;&gt;part1: Start of the tutorial: making a Derivative Idle clone with Svelte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/tutorial-for-idle-game-svelte-part2/&#34;&gt;part2: Going further with Svelte using components and props&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/tutorial-for-idle-game-svelte-part3/&#34;&gt;part3: Adding upgrades to the game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;objectives-for-this-part&#34;&gt;Objectives for this part&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this part we will learn how to use &lt;em&gt;components&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;props&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;state store&lt;/em&gt; to grow our game further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;make-more-buildings-using-components&#34;&gt;Make more buildings using components&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now we have one building producing money. That&amp;rsquo;s a start but it is not enough. What we want now is to make many more buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to do that would be to copy-paste the following code to add a new building:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;svelte&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;on:click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{updateNumbers}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;class:cantbuy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{cantBuy}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;disabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{cantBuy}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;{numberOfBuilding} buildings bought, next one cost {cost}$.&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;You gain {productionPerTick}$ / tick.&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;on:click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{updateNumbers}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;class:cantbuy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{cantBuy}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;disabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{cantBuy}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;{numberOfBuilding} buildings bought, next one cost {cost}$.&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;You gain {productionPerTick}$ / tick.&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try it yourself, it makes a second building. The problem is that the two buildings are identical, and they share their internal state. The number of building bought, the cost of it, how much money it generates each tick&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need a way to encapsulate those information locally to have each building handle this for itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is what components are for! (It&amp;rsquo;s the same concept in React[2] and Angular[3]). When you need to repeat the same independent elements (with slight variations) in different places, components are the way to go. They are also a nice way to have &lt;em&gt;building block&lt;/em&gt; (think Lego) for your application. Usually you can have big components for the header, footer and main page. Then you can have smaller components like forms and menus that you can reuse in bigger components. And you can also compose your smaller components from even smaller components. It creates a tree architecture, with the root being often named &lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt;, the main entry point to your app, and then the leaf and nodes are other components used to build your app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create one,  you need to create a &lt;code&gt;.svelte&lt;/code&gt; file. (You can see that &lt;code&gt;App.svelte&lt;/code&gt; is our root component here).Then inside the component you can declare some logic inside the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, some style inside the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag and then a html template. The script and style part are local to the component by default. You can declare a new component &lt;code&gt;Test.svelte&lt;/code&gt; that look like that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;6

&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;on:click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{updateNumbers}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;class:cantbuy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{cantBuy}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;disabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{cantBuy}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/img/blog_3_part2_component_local_style.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Showing components have scoped css&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see that even so we declared a red background for &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, because we declared it inside the component, the CSS is scoped and don&amp;rsquo;t interfere with the other elements on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go back to making a component for our buildings. You can delete &lt;code&gt;Test.svelte&lt;/code&gt;.  You can also delete in &lt;code&gt;App.svelte&lt;/code&gt; the import to &lt;code&gt;Test.svelte&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Test&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Test&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; code in the template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s create a component for our building. Create a file named &lt;code&gt;Building.svelte&lt;/code&gt; and we are gonna remove every parts relating to our building from &lt;code&gt;App.svelte&lt;/code&gt; to put it inside &lt;code&gt;Building.svelte&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are gonna remove everything from &lt;code&gt;App.svelte&lt;/code&gt; except we gonna import the Building component, keep the declaration for money and in the template keep the title and insert two Building components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;

  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;{numberOfBuilding} buildings bought, next one cost {cost}$.&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;You gain {productionPerTick}$ / tick.&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you click on the buildings, you see that they are independent, but a bit too much! They don&amp;rsquo;t share a common &lt;code&gt;money&lt;/code&gt; value anymore, each one use its own, and when they produce, it only goes to their own &lt;code&gt;money&lt;/code&gt; stash as well. That is not what we want. We would like for them to have a shared &lt;code&gt;money&lt;/code&gt; value, and then handle the rest of their state independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-the-store-to-handle-global-state&#34;&gt;Using the store to handle global state&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to have some global state that can be shared among components is to have a &lt;em&gt;store&lt;/em&gt; with value that components can subscribe to. They can also update the value if you allow them to, and any change to the value are propagated back to other component subscribing to that value as well. It is the same idea that React/Redux uses (or Reagent/re-frame&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in the ClojureScript ecosystem) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s create our store, we need a JS file that we will call &lt;code&gt;store.js&lt;/code&gt; and put some code in it: (I use &lt;code&gt;/* store.js */&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- store.js --&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to show you that the code belongs to &lt;code&gt;store.js&lt;/code&gt; because it&amp;rsquo;s no longer a template file, but a proper JS file. It allows you to copy paste my snippet without having an error into your editor.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;/* store.js */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;writable&lt;/span&gt; } &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;svelte/store&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;money&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;writable&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now we can use it inside our &lt;code&gt;App.svelte&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Building.svelte&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;App.svelte&lt;/code&gt;, we need to import it, remove the local variable declaration and change slightly the template where we used it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- App.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// import declarations
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  ...
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;money&lt;/span&gt; } &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;./store.js&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
  
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// variable declarations
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// we removed let money = 20;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  ...
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;You have {$money} $!&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Building&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Building&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Building&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Building&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;read-from-the-store&#34;&gt;Read from the store&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reference a value from the store, you prepend the dollar sign &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; before it&amp;rsquo;s name. Here to access the value of &lt;code&gt;money&lt;/code&gt; in the template we use &lt;code&gt;$money&lt;/code&gt;. What it does in reality is auto-subscribe to the store value, and unsubscribe to it when the component is destroyed using the &lt;code&gt;onDestroy&lt;/code&gt; lifecycle functions. &lt;code&gt;onDestroy&lt;/code&gt; is kind of the opposite of &lt;code&gt;onMount&lt;/code&gt;, it is called just after the component is unmounted from the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also opt out of the automatic subscribe and unsubscribe by doing it yourself, which allow more control over it. Let see what it would have looked like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;

&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;13

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- and here we can use &amp;#39;money_value&amp;#39; instead of $money. --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;You have {money_value} $!&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because it&amp;rsquo;s much shorter to use the shorthand, I&amp;rsquo;ll use for the rest of the tutorial. But keep in mind of what it does behind the scene.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;write-to-the-store-if-the-value-is-a-writable&#34;&gt;Write to the store (if the value is a &lt;code&gt;writable&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t update the value of the store like this: &lt;code&gt;$money += 1&lt;/code&gt;. You need to use the methods &lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;. For example if you want to update the value of money to add 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you want to give a totally new value to it you can use &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// set money to the greatest number ever
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;money&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on the store: &lt;a href=&#34;https://svelte.dev/tutorial/writable-stores&#34;&gt;Svelte store tutorial&lt;/a&gt; first and later &lt;a href=&#34;https://svelte.dev/docs#svelte_store&#34;&gt;Svelte doc&lt;/a&gt; to have more information on Writable, Readable, derived store value and &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;going-back-to-our-project&#34;&gt;Going back to our project&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know how to read and write to the store, we can update &lt;code&gt;Building.svelte&lt;/code&gt;. We need to import the store, change every instance of &lt;code&gt;money&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;$money&lt;/code&gt; and also change the way we change the value of  &lt;code&gt;money&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are gonna declare a new function that will &lt;em&gt;hide&lt;/em&gt; the fact that money is a store value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// update the value of `money` to the store, adding `n` to it.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;updateMoney&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;){
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;money&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; =&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But doing so, we need to rename the old &lt;code&gt;updateMoney&lt;/code&gt;  that was launching the &lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;launchSetTimeout&lt;/code&gt;. The name was not good before, and it is still not good, if you have any suggestion, I&amp;rsquo;ll gladly take it! And we can replace every instance where we add &lt;code&gt;money += something;&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;updateMoney(something);&lt;/code&gt;.  After all the transformation the code look like that (keeping only the parts that changed):&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;on:click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{updateNumbers}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;class:cantbuy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{cantBuy}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;disabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{cantBuy}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;Money: {$money}$&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  ...
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you can see that both the value of &lt;code&gt;money&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;App.svelte&lt;/code&gt; and both &lt;code&gt;Building.svelte&lt;/code&gt; is shared, but each building keep their numbers local otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/img/blog_3_part2_store_implemented.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Money is synchronized between all components.&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;naming-our-building-with-props&#34;&gt;Naming our building with props&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very short step, now that we have many buildings, it could be nice to give them a name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But remember that if we declare a variable inside a component, every instance of that component will have the same value for that variable. Not very helpful to have every building have the same name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we need is called &lt;strong&gt;props&lt;/strong&gt;. To draw an analogy, props are to a component what parameters are to a function. Props are used to initialize the component with some values. They are an essential building block because they allow to re-use component by giving them the flexibility they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To declare a prop, it&amp;rsquo;s like a variable declaration but with the keyword &lt;code&gt;export&lt;/code&gt; added at the front of the declaration. And also we can replace on the template the reference to &lt;code&gt;money&lt;/code&gt; with a reference to &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And to define the prop value, you define it like an HTML attribute on the &lt;code&gt;Building&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Building&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Combinatorics&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Building&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here is the result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/img/blog_3_part2_name_with_prop.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Building with their names&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;digging-a-bit-about-what-props-enable&#34;&gt;Digging a bit about what props enable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using props will allow us to customize a little more each building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now change many aspect of them like :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;their initial cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;their initial number (we can imagine starting off with a few buildings already built after buying an upgrade)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what they produce. Right now it&amp;rsquo;s money but they could produce another currency or even other buildings!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what they cost. Their cost could be another currency, another building or a combination of those. (Or even cost tick, accelerating or slowing down the game a you buy this building)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they could also have a maximum number of unit. (Example no more than 30 &amp;ldquo;Combinatorics&amp;rdquo; buildings and no limit for the &amp;ldquo;1th Derivative&amp;rdquo; building).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a lot more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a starting point, let&amp;rsquo;s change what they produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;building-producing-proofs&#34;&gt;Building producing proofs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the original &lt;em&gt;Derivative Clicker&lt;/em&gt; game, the primary currency is money but there is a secondary currency named &lt;strong&gt;proofs&lt;/strong&gt; that can be produced and is used to buy powerful buildings. (It is also one of the two element determining the amount of prestige currency you earn when you use the reset/prestige mechanic.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s implement proof :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the same reason &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt; was put into the store, we are gonna put &lt;em&gt;proofs&lt;/em&gt; there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;4

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;writable&lt;/span&gt; } &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;svelte/store&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;money&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;writable&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;proofs&lt;/span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;writable&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can then change the building component to replace explicit references to &lt;code&gt;money&lt;/code&gt; to a generic &lt;code&gt;currencyProduced&lt;/code&gt; that will can be either &lt;code&gt;money&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;proofs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then to tie it up, in &lt;code&gt;App.svelte&lt;/code&gt; we can import &lt;code&gt;proofs&lt;/code&gt; from the store, and pass it as a prop to the building we want. (and update the display of the value as well).&lt;/p&gt;

  ...
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Building&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;1th Derivative&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Building&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Building&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Combinatorics&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;currencyProduced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{proofs}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Building&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because gave a default value to &lt;code&gt;currencyProduced&lt;/code&gt; for buildings, we don&amp;rsquo;t need to use the prop for every building. But if we want to make it explicit, we can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Building&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;1th Derivative&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;currencyProduced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{money}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Building&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Building&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Combinatorics&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;currencyProduced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{proofs}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;Building&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note also that we did not need to import &lt;code&gt;proofs&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;Building.svelte&lt;/code&gt; (and we only need to import &lt;code&gt;money&lt;/code&gt; because we use it as the default value for &lt;code&gt;currencyProduced&lt;/code&gt;). We just import it in &lt;code&gt;App.svelte&lt;/code&gt; and pass either &lt;code&gt;money&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;proofs&lt;/code&gt; to the buildings. Then we rely on the fact that every store object can be read with &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; and updated with the &lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; method. The only constraint is that what we give as a props to the buildings must be a writable store reference on a number (because we update it with &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; inside the building component). To relax this constraint, we could fire an event in the building component that could be handled in his parent component, updating the currency however it wants to. But this feel a bit heavy, and we won&amp;rsquo;t go this way (for now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixing-the-ui&#34;&gt;Fixing the UI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now our &amp;ldquo;Combinatorics&amp;rdquo; building produces proofs, but we still display that it produces money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could do a function with lots of &lt;code&gt;if then else&lt;/code&gt; to display either &amp;ldquo;$&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;proof&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;proofs&amp;rdquo; or something else depending on what currency the building produce. Or we could add another prop to handle that. It means that we could have two building producing the same currency but displaying it differently. I&amp;rsquo;ll go with the first way of doing it because it will be quicker, but the second one is definitely more flexible (but I don&amp;rsquo;t think that will be needed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because we are fixing the UI, we will also make it closer to &lt;em&gt;Derivative Clicker&lt;/em&gt;. (at least for buildings)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we want a function that will display the currency depending on what we produce. We will add it to a new file: &lt;code&gt;utils.js&lt;/code&gt; because that function can be re-used in more than one component and is not tied to only one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;currency&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;proofs&lt;/span&gt;)
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;proofs&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;;
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use a &lt;code&gt;if else&lt;/code&gt; here, but a &lt;code&gt;switch case&lt;/code&gt; will probably scale better in readability if we get a lot more cases to handle. We will see how that pan out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s use that function in &lt;code&gt;Building.svelte&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;

&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Building.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// import declarations
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  ...
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;currencyToString&lt;/span&gt; } &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;./utils.js&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;; 
  
  ...

&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

...

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;on:click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{updateNumbers}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;class:cantbuy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{cantBuy}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;disabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{cantBuy}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;{name}&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;{buildingProduction}{currencyToString(currencyProduced)}/tick: costs {cost}$.&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;Owned:{numberOfBuilding} ({numberOfBuilding})&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get closer to the original game I changed &lt;code&gt;buildingProductionPerTick&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;buildingProduction&lt;/code&gt;. Both information are useful, we could display both, but I&amp;rsquo;ll stick with the original design and display only &lt;code&gt;buildingProduction&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I used &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Owned:{numberOfBuilding} ({numberOfBuilding})&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. It seems weird right now, but we will edit it later when we implement building producing buildings. Then it will be &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Owned:{numberOfBuildingTotal}  ({numberOfBuildingBought})&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;App.svelte&lt;/code&gt;, we can use the function as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- App.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// import declarations
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  ...
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;currencyToString&lt;/span&gt; } &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;./utils.js&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;; 
    
  ...
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;You have {$money}{currencyToString(money)} and {$proofs}{currencyToString(proofs)}!&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you follow closely, you may have noticed that the currency for the cost of the building is still hardcoded as &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; and not &lt;code&gt;currencyToString(money)&lt;/code&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s because for now we have not looked into buying building with other currency than money. We will change it when times come to implement that feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note also that &lt;code&gt;currencyToString()&lt;/code&gt; might possibly have been a component. (And that might have been a better implementation choice, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure). Try it out if you want!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;building-producing-buildings&#34;&gt;Building producing buildings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have building producing proofs, what about buildings producing buildings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do that, we need to change a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in &lt;code&gt;store.js&lt;/code&gt; we are gonna had new variables for each building we have so we can synchronize their number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in &lt;code&gt;Building.svelte&lt;/code&gt; we need to use this new variable, and update it when needed. Be careful when updating as the new variable will be a &lt;code&gt;writable&lt;/code&gt;, not a plain number. We will need to use &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; to dereference the value and &lt;code&gt;update()&lt;/code&gt;to update it. We also need to define new props to use those variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in &lt;code&gt;App.svelte&lt;/code&gt; we have to update the props and the template html to add the second level of buildings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 4

&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;You have {$money}{currencyToString(money)} and {$proofs}{currencyToString(proofs)}!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;Building name=&amp;#34;1th Derivative&amp;#34; numberOfBuilding={firstDerivativeNum}&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Building&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Building name=&amp;#34;Combinatorics&amp;#34; currencyProduced={proofs} numberOfBuilding={combinatoricsNum}&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Building&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Building name=&amp;#34;2nde Derivative&amp;#34; currencyProduced={firstDerivativeNum} numberOfBuilding={secondDerivativeNum}&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Building&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have that, we can generate other buildings :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little tweak to fix the UI again, the &amp;ldquo;2nd Derivative&amp;rdquo; building display a &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; instead of the name of the building it produces. To fix that we need to update &lt;code&gt;utils.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair, the UI needs a lot more fixing but it will do for now ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By doing this we introduced a &lt;del&gt;bug&lt;/del&gt; feature with the costs of the buildings, if you start by buying a building that produces another building, this building&amp;rsquo;s costs will go up even so we did not buy any manually. We will &lt;del&gt;fix this bug&lt;/del&gt; reverse this feature in the next tutorial when we will implement upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;objectives-for-the-next-parts&#34;&gt;Objectives for the next parts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few things to implement still:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the stats recap at the top&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make buildings have varying costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrades for our buildings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prestige layer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Options (Save, Export Save, Load Save, Stats, number formatting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balancing the game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue in the next part:&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/tutorial-for-idle-game-svelte-part3/&#34;&gt;part3: Adding upgrades to the game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;webpack-cli-crashes-for-windows-users-but-only-on-monday&#34;&gt;Webpack-cli crashes for Windows users, but only on Monday&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like a headline from the Onion&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But unfortunately it&amp;rsquo;s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webpack-cli&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; had a bug&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; recently because it tried to display a message for donations on the terminal when using it. But that message was only displayed on Monday(because there were complaints about seeing the donation message every time you were running a build).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a bug was introduced into that code because it relies on &lt;code&gt;process.getuid &lt;/code&gt; which is not available on Windows, making the CLI crash but only on Windows and on Monday \(**)/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;similar-story&#34;&gt;Similar story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like weird bug story, you can also read:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tutorial for an Idle game with Svelte (Part1)</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;making-a-derivative-idle-clone-with-svelte&#34;&gt;Making a Derivative Idle clone with Svelte&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first part of a multi part tutorial on making a game with Svelte&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. (If you have not read it already, I made an introduction to Svelte you can find right below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/introduction-to-svelte/&#34;&gt;introduction to Svelte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/tutorial-for-idle-game-svelte-part1/&#34;&gt;part1: Start of the tutorial: making a Derivative Idle clone with Svelte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/tutorial-for-idle-game-svelte-part2/&#34;&gt;part2: Going further with Svelte using components and props&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/tutorial-for-idle-game-svelte-part3/&#34;&gt;part3: Adding upgrades to the game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tutorial&#34;&gt;Tutorial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start the Derivative Clicker&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; tutorial :) I&amp;rsquo;ll try to introduce concept as they come but you are expected to already know a bit of HTML, CSS and some programming concepts like variables, functions, loop and recursion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the following tutorial I&amp;rsquo;ll use the Svelte REPL&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but you can also follow instructions on the Svelte Getting Started&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; page  to set yourself up with your favorite editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little word of warning, it&amp;rsquo;s my first Svelte project so I may do things that are not optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I will write some invalid HTML (invalid as in not W3C compliant) to not have to use CSS until the very end of the tutorial because it&amp;rsquo;s not the focus of this project. I will take care of pointing out when I take those shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also my English is far from perfect so hit me up with a message at &lt;em&gt;contact AT julienrouse.com&lt;/em&gt; when you see an error so I can correct it and try to learn from my mistake to not do it again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction-to-the-game-and-scope-of-the-tutorial&#34;&gt;Introduction to the game and scope of the tutorial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-is-derivative-clicker&#34;&gt;What is Derivative Clicker&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before trying to create a copy of a game, lets talk a bit about what is the essence of this particular game. Derivative Clicker is an idle game. The idle genre resolve around making a number go big, usually by buying things that generate some form of currency. Then with that currency you can buy more stuff that generate more currency. There is usually no end game, just the pleasure to see your number grow bigger and bigger (until the browser can&amp;rsquo;t display your number because it&amp;rsquo;s too big :) ). Sometimes the game continue to generate currency even when you are not online but not always (not in this case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you start with no cash and when you click on a button you gain some cash. Then after clicking a few times, with your hard earned cash you can buy something (I&amp;rsquo;ll call it &amp;ldquo;building&amp;rdquo; in the rest of the tutorial) that will generate a little bit of cash every &lt;em&gt;tick&lt;/em&gt;. There is a &lt;em&gt;tick&lt;/em&gt; every 1000ms (1 second) but as you progress, &lt;em&gt;ticks&lt;/em&gt; can go faster, accelerating production. Then as you go further into the game, you can buy more buildings that generate either more cash or more buildings. (Like Russian dolls, there is always an extra layer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also buy upgrades for your buildings that will make then more efficient, less costly or upgrades that will simulate clicks. (And some games have more elaborate ways of upgrading the game).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also because the cost of buildings will grow exponentially but the growth of cash production will be less than exponential, at some point we will hit a time wall where we can&amp;rsquo;t buy new buildings before a long time. That is where &lt;em&gt;reset&lt;/em&gt; comes in. The &lt;em&gt;reset&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;prestige&lt;/em&gt;) mechanic allow you to reset the game entirely from the start. But why would you do that? Because resetting gives you some form of bonus that helps you progress further into the game. Some elaborate games features more than one &lt;em&gt;prestige&lt;/em&gt; layer. For our case, &lt;em&gt;prestige&lt;/em&gt; gives us prestige currency that gives a percentage bonus to our building production. How many prestige currency you get depends on how big your numbers are at the time you reset. The prestige currency is also used to buy some powerful upgrades (for example unlocking new buildings) that allow to progress further. So you have to balance keeping the prestige currency for it&amp;rsquo;s production boost or spending it to gain other bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-we-will-aim-for&#34;&gt;What we will aim for&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create buildings that generate cash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create buildings that generate other currencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create buildings that generate other buildings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have some upgrades&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have some form of prestige mechanic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have some form of statistics for the game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Svelte :) And discover its many features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note that you can peak at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gzgreg/DerivativeClicker/tree/gh-pages&#34;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; of the game (itself forked from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Icehawk78/DerivativeClicker/tree/gh-pages&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). For this tutorial we won&amp;rsquo;t follow this code, but create a game similar to it from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hello-world&#34;&gt;Hello World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first line  &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- App.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;  is to indicate the name of the file, here &lt;code&gt;App.svelte&lt;/code&gt; and it&amp;rsquo;s just for the tutorial. You do not need to include that line in your project, it&amp;rsquo;s for helping you follow along the tutorial&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- App.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;world&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;Hello {name}!&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;File ending in &lt;code&gt;.svelte&lt;/code&gt; are kind of like &lt;code&gt;.html&lt;/code&gt;.  They are mostly composed of HTML tags and components. (We will see after how to define our own components).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also define some logic inside &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and reference it inside the html template. Above we declared a variable &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and gave it the value &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;world&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Then inside the template we reference it with the syntax &lt;code&gt;{name}&lt;/code&gt; to inject its value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use the REPL, you should see on the right side in the &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt; pane a big bold &lt;strong&gt;Hello world!&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/img/blog_3_svelte_helloworld.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Svelte Hello World&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;creating-the-first-building&#34;&gt;Creating the first building&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you recall the little introduction on idle games, building are things that you can buy and then they generate something every tick. (or every X tick, or twice per tick or whenever. Here we will start by producing money every tick.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for this first step we need to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep track of cash (our primary currency)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep track of how many numbers of building we bought (cause the price of the building depends on the number of building, and how much cash is generated each tick is also dependent on how many buildings there are).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a function that will be used every tick (to gain currency)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s keep track of cash in our game : &lt;code&gt;let money = 20&lt;/code&gt; and start with 20 units of it. And by modifying a bit the &lt;code&gt;Hello World&lt;/code&gt; example, you can show the amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- App.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;money&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; You have {money} $ &amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next to represent a building, we will use a button. If you click on it, you buy it, deducting its price from your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need two variables: one for the price and one for the number of building bought:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- App.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;money&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;cost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;numberOfBuilding&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then we can use those variable in the template with curly braces syntax &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt; we saw earlier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- App.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;{numberOfBuilding} building bought, next one cost {cost}$&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far so good :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to actually do something when we click on the button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;buying-a-building--with-event-and-event-handler&#34;&gt;Buying a building  with event and event handler&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We add an event handler to do something when you click on the button. In Svelte you can intercept any event with &lt;code&gt;on:&lt;/code&gt; followed by the event name. Here the event is &lt;code&gt;click&lt;/code&gt; so we use &lt;code&gt;on:click={clickHandler}&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;clickHandler&lt;/code&gt; is a function that is called when a click is registered.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- App.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;on:click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{()=&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;alert(&amp;#39;The button was clicked&amp;#39;)}&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;{numberOfBuilding} building bought, next one cost {cost}$&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will trigger a JS alert each time the button is clicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case we want to update our cash, the number of building and the cost of the next building. Let&amp;rsquo;s define a function &lt;code&gt;updateNumbers&lt;/code&gt; that do exactly that. *Note that for now we use a linear growth function to calculate building cost, but usually idle games define a cost with exponential growth. We will change that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;cost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;numberOfBuilding&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;; 
  }	
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the template for the button:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- App.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;on:click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{updateNumbers}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;{numberOfBuilding} building bought, next one cost {cost}$&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seems to works :) But if you click more than three times on the button you will see that our money goes into negative value :( We need to restrict buying only when we have enough money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/img/blog_3_svelte_negative_money.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Money goes into negative&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;restrict-buying-building-only-when-we-have-the-money&#34;&gt;Restrict buying building only when we have the money&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we want is to block the button when we have less money than the cost. We could write it that way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- App.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;on:click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{updateNumbers}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;disabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;{cost &amp;gt; money}&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;{numberOfBuilding} building bought, next one cost {cost}$&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But maybe we will need the boolean condition &lt;code&gt;cost &amp;gt; money&lt;/code&gt; in other places as well, and it is better not to repeat many times the same logic (see DRY principle). If later on we need to change it, we&amp;rsquo;d have to find all the places we used it. (Spoiler alert: we will need to have that condition in more than one place, and we will also need to change it slightly later). 
To solve that little problem, we are going to use reactive declarations&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;refactoring-using-reactive-declarations&#34;&gt;Refactoring using reactive declarations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactive declarations are a way to declare variable that depends on other variables.  When the value of the variables they depend on change, their own value will be recomputed (they react to change hence the name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are going to write one such reactive declaration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- App.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  ... &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// here goes the code for the variable declarations
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;cantBuy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;cost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;money&lt;/span&gt;

  ... &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// here goes the rest of the code
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now we can use it in our button:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- App.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;on:click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{updateNumbers}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;disabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{cantBuy}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;{numberOfBuilding} bought, next one cost {cost}$&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below you can see the result, we can no longer click on the button when we can&amp;rsquo;t afford it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/img/blog_3_svelte_no_more_negative_money.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Money goes into negative&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another place we can use reactive declarations is with the &lt;code&gt;cost&lt;/code&gt; variable. Remember that to update the cost we used &lt;code&gt;cost = (numberOfBuilding + 1) * 5;&lt;/code&gt;. That too can be expressed as a reactive declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 4

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can buy buildings, can&amp;rsquo;t buy them when we don&amp;rsquo;t have the money. We need now to make them generate money!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;making-buildings-generates-money&#34;&gt;Making buildings generates money&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do that, we need to trigger a function every X millisecond. In JS we can use &lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will declare a &lt;code&gt;tickSpeed&lt;/code&gt; variable that will be the X for the interval for &lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt;. Later on it will allow us to increase or decrease (mostly decrease) the value of &lt;code&gt;tickSpeed&lt;/code&gt; to accelerate the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also declare a variable &lt;code&gt;buildingProduction&lt;/code&gt; to represent how much money each building produce every tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And last we declare a new function &lt;code&gt;updateMoney&lt;/code&gt; that will update the amount of money we have and trigger a &lt;code&gt;timeOut&lt;/code&gt; to get called again after &lt;code&gt;tickSpeed&lt;/code&gt; milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;changes-to-the-ui&#34;&gt;Changes to the UI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first part of the tutorial we implemented all the feature we planned to but we could add some visual changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;add-more-stats&#34;&gt;Add more stats&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we earn money each tick, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be nice to see how much we earn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the template we can just add &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You gain {numberOfBuilding * buildingProduction}$ / tick.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to have more information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;on:click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{updateNumbers}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;disabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{cantBuy}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;{numberOfBuilding} buildings bought, next one cost {cost}$.&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;You gain {numberOfBuilding * buildingProduction}$ / tick.&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: yes I inserted two &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; inside the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/code&gt;. It is not the recommended way to make two lines of text one below the other in a button but for now it will do. (I checked a w3c validator&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and indeed it is not valid.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can test it, buy a couple buildings and you&amp;rsquo;ll see how much money you get each tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by doing that, we introduced some redundancy. We used &lt;code&gt;numberOfBuilding * buildingProduction&lt;/code&gt; which is already used in the function &lt;code&gt;updateMoney&lt;/code&gt;. We can utilize a reactive declaration again to not repeat this operation in multiple place, and also replace it in the code in all the places it was used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- App.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;updateMoney&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;tickSpeed&lt;/span&gt;);
  }
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;  

...

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;on:click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{updateNumbers}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;disabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{cantBuy}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  ...
  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;You gain {productionPerTick}$ / tick.&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when you replace everything that way, you get an error: &lt;code&gt;can&#39;t access lexical declaration &#39;productionPerTick&#39; before initialization&lt;/code&gt;. What is means it that we try to use &lt;code&gt;productionPerTick&lt;/code&gt; (which rely on other variables) before Svelte has even initialized those variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resolve this problem, we will have to use some lifecycle functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;introducing-lifecycle-functions-onmount&#34;&gt;Introducing lifecycle functions: &lt;code&gt;onMount&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svelte (like React and Angular) provides function that you can redefine to customize the comportment of the components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we can use &lt;code&gt;onMount&lt;/code&gt; to only call the function &lt;code&gt;updateMoney&lt;/code&gt; (and consequently use &lt;code&gt;productionPerTick&lt;/code&gt;) only once Svelte has been initialized. (Or rather, once Svelte has initialized the &lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;component&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to use &lt;code&gt;onMount&lt;/code&gt; we need to import it first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;

&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 1

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt; 3

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we do that the error disappear and the application works again. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on &lt;code&gt;onMount&lt;/code&gt; and other lifecycle functions, see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://svelte.dev/docs#onMount&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://svelte.dev/tutorial/onmount&#34;&gt;onMount tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;adding-some-visual-cues&#34;&gt;Adding some visual cues&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to finish this tutorial, let&amp;rsquo;s add some visual cues for the button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to change the background color for the button and change the mouse cursor depending on if we can buy it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can style elements directly into our &lt;code&gt;.svelte&lt;/code&gt; files with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.  We are defining a default style for the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag then a style for &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that has the &lt;code&gt;cantbuy&lt;/code&gt; class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- App.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  ...
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; {
	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;outline&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;black&lt;/span&gt;;
	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;aliceblue&lt;/span&gt;;
	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;pointer&lt;/span&gt;;
  }

  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;cantbuy&lt;/span&gt; {
	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;#555&lt;/span&gt;;
	&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;#DDD&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;;
  }
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we need to add this &lt;code&gt;cantbuy&lt;/code&gt; class to the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; only when we cannot buy it. Luckily we can re-use the &lt;em&gt;reactive declaration&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;cantBuy&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- App.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;on:click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{updateNumbers}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;class:cantbuy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{cantBuy}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;disabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{cantBuy}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
 ...
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;code&gt;class:cantbuy={cantBuy}&lt;/code&gt; means Svelte will add the class &lt;code&gt;cantbuy&lt;/code&gt; to the element only when the variable &lt;code&gt;cantBuy&lt;/code&gt; is true. You can also write it with a ternary expression: &lt;code&gt;class={cantBuy ? &#39;cantbuy&#39; : &#39;&#39;}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can play with the example &lt;a href=&#34;https://svelte.dev/repl/4181423ac05b4041ad9e449c666828d5?version=3.4.2&#34;&gt;in the Svelte REPL&lt;/a&gt; yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also &lt;a href=&#34;http://tuto-derivative-clicker-part1.surge.sh/&#34;&gt;play the game we made so far here&lt;/a&gt; (hosted by Surge&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction-to-svelte&#34;&gt;Introduction to Svelte&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to try out Svelte&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so I made a little clone of a game called Derivative Clicker&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Following is a very quick presentation of what is Svelte (and how it compares to other reactive framework like React&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, Angular&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, etc) then a multi part tutorial on how to make a little game app with Svelte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/introduction-to-svelte/&#34;&gt;introduction to Svelte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/tutorial-for-idle-game-svelte-part1/&#34;&gt;part1: Start of the tutorial: making a Derivative Idle clone with Svelte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/tutorial-for-idle-game-svelte-part2/&#34;&gt;part2: Going further with Svelte using components and props&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/tutorial-for-idle-game-svelte-part3/&#34;&gt;part3: Adding upgrade to the game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;svelte&#34;&gt;Svelte&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svelte is in competition with React, Angular and other framework to build reactive Single Page Application, but the difference is Svelte shifts the work from the browser to the compiler. It still delivers Reactive Single page application but with a very reduced size. Similar initiative can be found as well with Aurelia&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project went to version 3 a month ago (early may 2019), I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good time to try it out :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pros&#34;&gt;PROS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Svelte tutorial&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is great, it takes about an hour or so and is very well done. It uses the Svelte REPL&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and it introduces concepts very smoothly. Also it uses mostly the same concepts as React, Vue&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Angular. If you know at least one of those you should pick it up quickly. (Component, reactive bindings, props, event forwarding, state store, component life cycle and slots to name a few concepts used) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also the Svelte website features a very nice REPL that you can use to test Svelte app without installing anything. When you are ready for the next step, the &lt;em&gt;get started section&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is handy. It&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of cloning a template from a git&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; repository and use the tools you are used to: &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;code&gt;webpack&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rollup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or &lt;code&gt;browserify&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And for the deployment, there are instructions a quick setup with Now&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Surge&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or you can choose you favorite deployment option as you would for any other JS or TypeScript project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another pro, look at this article for a &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-realworld-comparison-of-front-end-frameworks-with-benchmarks-2019-update-4be0d3c78075&#34;&gt;RealWorld benchmark&lt;/a&gt; to get a feel of how Svelte can be very slim compared to its rivals. (Note that the benchmark was done with Svelte v2, and right now it is already Svelte v3, so take it with a grain of salt).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cons&#34;&gt;CONS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it got traction recently but it still is not widely used so there not much educational material yet. If you can&amp;rsquo;t do with only the official tutorial and API documentation, you should wait a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also Svelte miss features like routing (but this is apparently addressed in the sister framework Sapper&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which aims to be a replacement for Next.js&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And last but not least, it has some weird syntax choices. The dollar sign &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; has two different uses dependent on the context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;My name is {$name}&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Here $name is a reference to name, a value in a state store --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t like that choice. Note also that the second syntax is a shorthand syntax, you can subscribe manually to values in the store and name them without the &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; so if you really care about that you can opt out (at the price of 3-4 lines of manual wiring).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And syntax for conditional in template is also not very sexy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;{{ #if condition }}
&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;Inside the if&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
{{ /if}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I guess it&amp;rsquo;s more a matter of personal taste.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PSD1 certification post-mortem</title>
      <link>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/professional-scrum-developer-certification-post-mortem/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 May 2019 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.julienrouse.com/blog/professional-scrum-developer-certification-post-mortem/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;professional-scrum-developer-certification-post-mortem&#34;&gt;Professional Scrum Developer certification post-mortem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure post-mortem is the right expression.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a few weeks ago I obtained the PSD1 certification from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scrum.org&#34;&gt;scrum.org&lt;/a&gt; and this is a recap on my learning experience. Also at the end there are tips for you if you want to try it as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disclaimer-about-certifications&#34;&gt;Disclaimer about certifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certifications are a cash cow for the very lucrative professional training industry, no doubts. Some certifications are good, some are bad, some are total scams. And they are not well received in all organizations. Nevertheless sometimes they hold some value (even if it is only the value of motivating you to learn new things in exchange of a &lt;del&gt;useless&lt;/del&gt; shiny piece of (electronic) paper.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for PSD1, I have no idea which category it belongs to. It definitely is worth it if your employer pay for it or if it enable a raise and/or enable you to have access to more job opportunities (or mission opportunities for consultants).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivations&#34;&gt;Motivations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some spare time at work between missions so in parallel with getting myself up to date with front-end technologies (Flutter, Dart, NativeScript), I spent some times learning and training myself for this certification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I was hoping to get out of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting access to mission needing Agile/Scrum experience. I had some exposure to Scrum and Kanban during a 8 weeks summer job in an web agency in the past (using Java, Spring and some JavaScript and jQuery) but a few times this year it was not enough to be selected for that mission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually learning more about Scrum. As it turns out, I knew already most of the topics covered (more than what I anticipated).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As bonus motivation, I had the privilege to have my colleague Nathalie (a very experienced Agile coach) give me a training session on Scrum and Agility and when she was at the office she took the time to answer my questions which was very very valuable! Thanks very much to her!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-journey&#34;&gt;My journey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first started practicing for this test back in October 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read the Scrum Guide in French, then practiced with the quiz on scrum.org (they call it &amp;ldquo;Open Assessments&amp;rdquo;) at least four times a day. I was doing mostly the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-developer-open&#34;&gt;Scrum Developer Open&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; one, but also the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-open&#34;&gt;Scrum Open&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; which is more generalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One caveat was that both the open assessments and the real test are in English and I had prepared in French. Most of the terms were understandable but sometimes I got confused and I began again reading and studying the Scrum Guide in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my mission started I kept practicing, doing two to three quiz in the evening when I got home. I kept doing it for three weeks. After all that, I was scoring consistently above 95% (passing grades are 80%) so I was feeling pretty confident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then life happened, I stopped taking time for training and I stopped practicing altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s only in the beginning of May 2019 that I came back to the certification (and after having completed a Coursera course &amp;ldquo;Learning how to learn&amp;rdquo; which gives some insight on how to learn more effectively). It was a good surprise to me when I started doing practice tests again that I still remembered a lot of the material and started scoring above 90% right away. In retrospective and with what I learned in the Coursera course, I think I remembered so much because I spaced my learning over the span of many weeks, and I took a lot of practice test. Both are good ways to enhance retention in long term memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then after only a few day of being back to practice, I decided to attempt the certification. I was feeling ready and scored 100% at every test attempt for two days straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-exam&#34;&gt;The exam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exam is 80 questions, 60 minutes and you need 85% to pass (at most 12 errors allowed). It cost also 200$USD (269$CAD at the time I bought it), which is not a lot for a certification but still enough for being motivated to not screw it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my impression on it was that it was hard! After acing every test I thought it would be a piece of cake but not at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the exam focus on majority on what the practice exam test you on, there are also questions relevant to a Product Owner or a Scrum Master role in the scrum team. I did not prepare very well for Scrum Master nor Product Owner questions (out of all the tests I did, only 3 or 4 were about Scrum Master and 1 only about Product owner) because in the certification details they said to prepare with the 2 open assessments I used. It was a bad move on my part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, my two months summer job in a scrum team in 2012 helped me figure out some of the &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo; questions, and I passed the exam successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is one lesson to remember here: &lt;em&gt;When preparing for any kind of exam, don&amp;rsquo;t prepare exclusively for the subject matter, open your perspective and learn more than what is expected.&lt;/em&gt; Also a side benefit is that you actually gain more knowledge and over the course of many months/years, it can be really significant to have pushed for a little more knowledge in term of your global comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tips-for-earning-the-psd1-certificate&#34;&gt;Tips for earning the PSD1 certificate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a lot of open assessments: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-developer-open&#34;&gt;Scrum Developper Open&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-open&#34;&gt;Scrum Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scrumguides.org/index.html&#34;&gt;Scrum Guide&lt;/a&gt; (I recommend in English because the exam is exclusively in English)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a lot of open assessments again: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-developer-open&#34;&gt;Scrum Developper Open&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-open&#34;&gt;Scrum Open&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/product-owner-open&#34;&gt;Product Owner Open&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/nexus-open&#34;&gt;Nexus Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Space out your learning, try to do it a little bit every day for at least 2-3 weeks instead of cramming all practice in 1-2 days. You might be able to take the exam successfully if you cram, but you won&amp;rsquo;t build long term memories about what you learn. And while having the certification is great, gaining the knowledge for a long time is more important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read books and articles about Scrum, Agility, TDD, refactoring, Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, and more! The &lt;a href=&#34;http://agilemanifesto.org/&#34;&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; is a good start, then look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scrum.org/resources/suggested-reading-professional-scrum-developer&#34;&gt;Suggested Read List for PSD&lt;/a&gt; on scrum.org. (Mind that most of those are affiliate links.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have experienced scrum practitioners around you available to help you, jump on the occasion. As with most discipline, the insights of an experienced peer can really help you increase your knowledge very quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally if you have the means, there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scrum.org/courses&#34;&gt;training sessions&lt;/a&gt; but it is very expensive. A 3 day session in Ottawa for preparing PSD is approximatively 2000$CAD (1482$USD at the time of writing). O_O&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also other website offering training sessions as an alternative if you want to shop for a better price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My opinion on training for PSD is that it is probably not worth it (even if your employer pays for it) as the learning material is very abundant and the open assessments gives you 75% of what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
