	<h1 id="race-for-the-galaxy-milestone">Race for the galaxy milestone</h1>
<p>Since 2019, I played almost 1000 games of Race for the Galaxy (online on <a href="https://boardgamearena.com/">boardgamearena</a>). So to mark this milestone, I am writing down a few tips and observations, and hopefully when I&rsquo;ll hit 2000, 5000 or even 10 000 games I&rsquo;ll be able to see if I still agree.</p>
<p>I am currently around 350ELO on boardgamearena, with a top around 420 last year. Best players are at least 550 I think, so I have a long way to go.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: all discussions in this post are about the base Race for the Galaxy game, two-players only and with the &ldquo;New Worlds&rdquo; variant. (at the start of the game, choose between two worlds instead of being locked with only one).</p>
<p>Note that I won&rsquo;t explain what Race for the Galaxy is in this post, maybe another time. But your favorite search engine will help you find out all about this wonderful card game ;)</p>
<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
<h3 id="first-turn-settle-surfing">First turn settle &ldquo;surfing&rdquo;</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not actually sure what&rsquo;s the actual term for this action, but I call &ldquo;surfing&rdquo; when you bet on the other player choosing a specific action, so you don&rsquo;t take it and choose another one to speed you up.</p>
<p>A very common way to do this (and quite powerful too), on the first turn is to select the &ldquo;trade&rdquo;/&ldquo;produce&rdquo; phase without selecting the &ldquo;settle&rdquo; phase. This way, if your opponent select &ldquo;settle&rdquo;, you get to draw cards immediately, and because often the first world played is a windfall one, you get to &ldquo;trade&rdquo; the next turn but your opponent won&rsquo;t be able to. So you gain some tempo on him.</p>
<p>This works better if your starting world is a producing one, because then you produce one good at least, and two in the best case.</p>
<p>I climbed from 300 to 350ELO recently in large part because I had the opportunity to use this opener, and that helped me snowball faster to the finish line than my opponent.</p>
<h3 id="lost-species-ark-card-is-a-trap-early-mid-game">&ldquo;Lost Species Ark&rdquo; card is a trap early-mid game</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Lost Species Ark&rdquo; is a green card costing 5, producing genes good and allowing to draw two cards on the &ldquo;produce&rdquo; phase. For a long time, I thought this card was marvelous and would try to keep it in my opening hand and playing it as soon as possible, because I thought the payoff would be so worth it.</p>
<p>In reality, what it did most of the time was getting me in a situation where I would spend all my cards to play this one, then desperately &ldquo;trade&rdquo;/&ldquo;produce&rdquo; for a couple turn because I was card starved, and if my opponents were half-decent, they would &ldquo;develop&rdquo;/&ldquo;settle&rdquo; so much in the meantime that I would be too much behind.</p>
<p>Almost the only way to play this card is toward the endgame, or when you have the 2-cost development that allows you to play any world for free. And having both in your starting hand can sometimes be a great opener if you &ldquo;develop&rdquo;/&ldquo;produce&rdquo; and you surf on your opponent &ldquo;settle&rdquo;. But this is a lot of &ldquo;ifs&rdquo;, most of the time, avoid playing this card early at any cost, it&rsquo;s very rarely worth it.</p>
<h3 id="two-rare-productionwindfall-worlds--the-6-rare-development">Two rare production/windfall worlds + the 6 rare development</h3>
<p>Two rare production/windfall worlds + the 6 rare development can be an opener to &ldquo;consume x2&rdquo;/&ldquo;produce&rdquo; very early and consume 6VPs per round, hopefully closing the game early enough that your opponent will still be trying to find a strategy.</p>
<p>The downside is that you won&rsquo;t draw any card once you are starting with this, so it&rsquo;s a sink or swin strategy.</p>
<p>One way to make it work is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>have your opening world be the rare windfall world that discounts other rare worlds, one rare world costing one (or two) (preferably a windfall one) and the 6-cost development. This will require you have 8-9 cards in hand to put everythings</li>
<li>first turn: &ldquo;explore +1/+1&rdquo; / &ldquo;trade&rdquo; to get 5 cards. Hopefully, your opponent &ldquo;settle&rdquo; so you can play you rare world.</li>
<li>second turn: &ldquo;develop&rdquo; / &ldquo;produce&rdquo;. If your opponent did not settle the turn before, you hope he does now.</li>
<li>If your opponent did settle on turn 1 or 2, you now have 2 goods and the development, so you hammer down the &ldquo;consume x2&rdquo; / &ldquo;produce&rdquo; phase to end in 4 turns. If not, you have to waster another turn to settle but usually, people play at least one world early on so I think in most cases you could expect to be set up.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recording-games-to-review-your-play">Recording games to review your play</h2>
<p>This one is also a tip, but I&rsquo;ll put it in its own category.</p>
<p>In various fields, you can read that recording yourself and reviewing your plays can help you see mistakes and correct them. It&rsquo;s true for sports, videogames, and probably a bunch of other activities so let&rsquo;s try it for this game! Also when I face better opponents, that could help me review their game instead of mine to see if I can grab some strategies or tricks from them.</p>
<p>I am only trying this one for the past five games, so I will need to report on the results later on, but what I see right now is that by putting the energy to record myself, I play more focused, which increase my odds of winning.</p>
<p>This is also very easy to set up, I use simplescreenrecorder myself but a bunch of alternatives exists (Kazam, OBS to quote a few).</p>
<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>
<p>I would like to write a bit more about Race for the Galaxy, it&rsquo;s a very fun game (most of the time). We&rsquo;ll see how the next 1000 games will go!</p>
